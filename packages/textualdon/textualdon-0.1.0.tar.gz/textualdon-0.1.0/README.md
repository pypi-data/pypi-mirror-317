TextualDon aims to be a full-featured, graphical Mastodon client that lives inside of your terminal.

It offers a new take on 'social media in the terminal' compared to other apps. 
TextualDon leverages the full power of Textual to provide an almost website-like 
experience in a keyboard-centric TUI format.

### Features:

- For keyboard lovers: Designed for 100% keyboard control (Or just mouse, or a mix).
- Cross-platform: Works across Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- Auto login and load specific pages on launch
- Support for images (And option to disable downloading them entirely).
- Looks good in most default Textual themes
- Many more to come
