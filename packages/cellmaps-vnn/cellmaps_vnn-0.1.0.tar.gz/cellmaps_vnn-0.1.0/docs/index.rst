The Cell Maps VNN Tool enables creation, training, and usage of an interpretable neural network-based model that predicts cell response to a drug. A hierarchy in `HCX <https://cytoscape.org/cx/cx2/hcx-specification/>`__ format generated by
`cellmaps_generate_hierarchy tool <https://cellmaps-generate-hierarchy.readthedocs.io/>`__ is used to define the structure of the visible neural network. 

This tool creates an output directory (for both training and prediction) where results are stored and registered
within `Research Object Crates (RO-Crate) <https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate>`__ using
the `FAIRSCAPE-cli <https://pypi.org/project/fairscape-cli>`__.

.. warning::

    At the moment, this tool enables a user to perform training and predictions using data
    for `NeST VNN <https://github.com/idekerlab/nest_vnn>`__ project.
