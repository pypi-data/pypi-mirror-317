## [3.0.0] - 2024-06-02

This release follows the [Dahlia Specification v1.0.0][spec].

### Added
- Automatic color depth detection (as a consequence, `Dahlia`'s `depth`
  parameter can now be `None`)
- [Style-specific reset codes][spec-reset]
- [The `&_` escape code][spec-esc]
- The `clean_ansi` function should now handle way more ANSI escape codes
- The package can now be executed with `python -m dahlia` to show the current
  terminal emulator's capabilities
- Various performance improvements:
  - String conversions are now approximately ~70% faster
  - A comprehensive benchmark showed an overall library speedup of 20%

### Changed
- The "Blink" style code was changed from `&p` to `&k`
- The custom color syntax was changed from `&[#ffaff3]` to `&#ffaff3;` and now
  supports shorthand 3-digit codes
- The `Dahlia.depth` property now returns a `Depth | None` instead of an `int`
- The full reset code is now `&R` instead of `&r`
- The "Hide" style code was changed from `&k` to `&h`
- The `no_reset` parameter and property was renamed to `auto_reset` and now
  defaults to `True`

### Fixed
- Type checkers no longer complain about non-lowercase depth strings

### Removed
- `Dahlia.reset`
- `Dahlia.test`
- Dahlia's `no_color` parameter
- The CLI tool
- The `&g` code
- The legacy `dahlia`, `dprint`, and `dinput` functions
