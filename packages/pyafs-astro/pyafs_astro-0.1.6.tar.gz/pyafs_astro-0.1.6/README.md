# pyAFS: A Python implementation for Alpha-shape Fitting to Spectrum (AFS) algorithm

`pyAFS` is a Python package that offers a third-party implementation of the Alpha-shape Fitting to Spectrum (AFS) algorithm.
Originally developed in R by [Xu *et. al.* (2019)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ab1b47), AFS provides a data-driven method for continuum fitting and spectrum normalisation.
The original R implementation can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/xinxuyale/AFS).

Please note that `pyAFS` is independently developed and maintained.
For any bugs or issues related to `pyAFS`, please report them in this repository.

## Installation

To install `pyAFS`, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install pyafs-astro
```

Alternatively, you can clone this repository and install the package locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fengshun124/pyAFS.git
cd pyAFS
pip install .
```

## Dependencies

`pyAFS` requires Python 3.10 or later, as well as the following packages:

```plaintext
numpy
pandas
alphashape
loess
scipy
shapely
matplotlib  
```

## Usage

A simple example of using `afs` is shown below:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pyafs import afs

# load the spectrum data
data = pd.read_csv('spectrum.csv')

# normalise the spectrum
normalised_flux = afs(data['wavelength'], data['flux'])
```

A more detailed example can be found in the [example notebook](examples/afs.ipynb).
