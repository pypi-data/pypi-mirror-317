# Requirements

Python (3.9, 3.10, 3.11)

# Installing

`pip install blizzardapi2`
    
# Example

**main.py**
```python
from blizzardapi2 import BlizzardApi

api_client = BlizzardApi("client_id", "client_secret")

# Unprotected API endpoint
categories_index = api_client.wow.game_data.get_achievement_categories_index("us", "en_US")

# Protected API endpoint
summary = api_client.wow.profile.get_account_profile_summary("us", "en_US", "access_token")

# Wow Classic endpoint
connected_realms_index = api_client.wow.game_data.get_connected_realms_index("us", "en_US", is_classic=True)
```

# Access token vs Client ID/Client Secret

You can pass in a `client_id` and `client_secret` and use almost any endpoint except for a few that require an `access_token` obtained via OAuth authorization code flow. You can find more information at https://develop.battle.net/documentation/guides/using-oauth/authorization-code-flow.

Here is the list of endpoints, specified by Blizzard, that require an OAuth token.

```
GET /oauth/userinfo
GET /profile/user/wow
GET /profile/user/wow/protected-character/{realm-id}-{character-id}
GET /profile/user/wow/collections
GET /profile/user/wow/collections/pets
GET /profile/user/wow/collections/mounts
```
