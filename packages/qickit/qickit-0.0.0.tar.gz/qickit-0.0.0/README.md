`qickit` is an agnostic gate-based circuit SDK, providing an integrated interface for using any supported quantum circuit framework seamlessly, and provides a complete pipeline from construction of circuits to mapping on actual hardware.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12

### Quick Installation

`qickit` can be installed with the command:

```
pip install qickit
```

Pip will handle all dependencies automatically and you will always install the latest (and well-tested) version.

To install from source, follow the instructions in the [`documentation`]().

## Usage

The docs/examples are a good way for understanding how `qickit` works. Depending on your preference, you may use the package as end-to-end, or use it in parts for low-level modifications.

The `/notebooks` directory contains pedagogical material for utilizing `qickit`:

- [`Creating and Manipulating Circuits`](https://github.com/Qualition/QICKIT/blob/main/notebooks/Creating%20and%20Manipulating%20Circuits.ipynb)
: This notebook demonstrates the basics of creating quantum circuits, and how different existing frameworks have been integrated within `qickit`.
- [`Preparing Quantum States and Operators`](https://github.com/Qualition/QICKIT/blob/main/notebooks/Preparing%20Quantum%20States%20and%20Operators.ipynb)
: This notebook demonstrates how to prepare arbitrary statevectors and unitary operators to quantum circuits using exact encoding schema.
- [`Running Quantum Circuits`](https://github.com/Qualition/QICKIT/blob/main/notebooks/Running%20Quantum%20Circuits.ipynb)
: This notebook demonstrates the different backends available for running circuits, ranging from simulators to QPUs.

## Testing

Run tests with the command:

```
py -m pytest tests
```

To run all tests including slow ones, use:

```
py -m pytest tests --runslow
```
