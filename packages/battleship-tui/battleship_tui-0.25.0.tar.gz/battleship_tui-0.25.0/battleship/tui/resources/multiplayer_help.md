# Help
In Multiplayer mode you play against a human player. 

You can use your account to connect to the server or connect as a guest user. In the 
later case your nickname will be autogenerated and your game statistics won't be saved.

If you don't have an account, run 
```
$ battleship account signup
```
to create one.
