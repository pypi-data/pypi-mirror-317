title: What is faser?
description: A brief introduction to the faser software package.
---

faser is a Python-based software package designed to simulate the excitation point spread function (PSF) of optical microscopes. Faser calculates PSFs for high NA focusing by using a vectorial model of the electromagnetic field, enabling exploration of the impact of geometrical and optical parameters on imaging performance in advanced applications. The software supports various beam profiles, including those used in STED microscopy, and allows for the simulation of common experimental conditions such as a cranial window and a coverslip tilt.
