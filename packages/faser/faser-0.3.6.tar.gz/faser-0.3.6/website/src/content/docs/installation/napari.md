:::note

When downloading Napari make sure you are downloading the correct version for your operating system. Windows users should download the 64-bit version (x86_64) and Mac users should download the PKG versions that correspond to their chip architecture (i.e `arm64` for M1 Macs or `x86_64` for Intel based
chips).
