Automatically create [semantic version](https://semver.org/) git tags.

```shell
$ tag --push
Next version: v1.0.1
Tag v1.0.1 created and pushed to remote.
```

### Autocomplete

`tag` provides autocomplete for `bash`, `fish`, `powershell` and `zsh` shells.
For example, to enable autocomplete for the `bash` shell,

```shell
tag completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/tag > /dev/null
```

_Note: bash completion requires the [bash-completion](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion/) package be installed._

For more information, see `tag completion <shell> --help` for your respective `<shell>`.
