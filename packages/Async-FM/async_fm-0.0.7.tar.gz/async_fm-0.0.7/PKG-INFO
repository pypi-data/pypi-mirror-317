# AsyncFM

Python library for interacting with the Last.fm API asynchronously.

## Installation

```bash
pip install async-fm
```

# Usage
First, you need to obtain an API key and secret from Last.fm. You can do this by creating an account on their [developer site](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create).


```python
import asyncio
import asyncfm

lastfm = asyncfm.LastFMAPI(api_key="api_key_here")


async def main():
    # Get the recent tracks for a user
    tracks = await lastfm.user.get_recent_tracks(username="rj")

    for track in tracks.data:
        print(f" ~ {track.artist} - {track.title}: image {track.images.extralarge}")
    print(f"Total: {tracks.total}")


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Requirements
- aiohttp
- pydantic
