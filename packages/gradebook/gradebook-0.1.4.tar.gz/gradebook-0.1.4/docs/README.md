## Gradebook 

`v0.1.1`

### Overview

**Gradebook** is a Python CLI that provides straightforward methods for managing one's own academic records. It utilizes [`click`](https://github.com/pallets/click/) in conjunction with [`rich`](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) to compose an intuitive command-line frontend with fully implemented CRUD capabilities, along with convenient methods for visualizing summary data.

It is currently in its initial stages of development and is likely to undergo several significant changes before a stable public release is available.
