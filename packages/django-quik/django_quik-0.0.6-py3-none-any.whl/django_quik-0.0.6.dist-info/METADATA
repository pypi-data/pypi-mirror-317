# Django Quik

This project aims to provide extra power while developing Django applications such as livereload
while you modify template, static files .etc

It is a wrapper around Django CLI and you don't need to modify your existing code or add it in installed apps
like other livereload packages.

## Installation

```bash
pip install django-quik
```

Make sure to install this package inside the same virtual environment if your project is using.
Now open url: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)


## Usage

The main motivation for Django Quik is to provide features without modifying your any code.

```bash
django-quik runserver
```

You can use all the Django commands with django quik.

## Does it support WebSocket?

Yes, Django Quik supports HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1, and WebSocket protocol. The HTTP/1.1 is overridden to HTTP/1.0.

## How Django Quik works?

Django Quik creates the proxy server then starts Django development server internally. It acts as the middleman between
the client and the Django server. If the content type is `text/html` being served, it injects script to reload page
which will be triggered from `Server Side Event(SSE)`.

## Conclusion

I am planning to add `tailwind` support soon.
Note: I have tested in Linux and it works.
