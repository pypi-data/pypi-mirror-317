# About resources

Currently, there only two Mark Verifying Athorities that issue Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs) for use with [BIMI standard](https://bimigroup.org/implementation-guide/): [DigiCert](https://www.digicert.com/tls-ssl/verified-mark-certificates) and [Entrust](https://store.entrust.com/default/vmc.html).
They provide their customers with certificate chains containing the intermediate certificate and VMC. The root certificates for these certificates are different than the root certificates used for browsers.
