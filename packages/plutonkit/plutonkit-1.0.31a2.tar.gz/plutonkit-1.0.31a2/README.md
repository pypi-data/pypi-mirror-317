## Introduction
Building from scratch is quite a daunting task. Constructing your thought, looking for feature and research it will take alot of your time in figuring what will you do next. Therefore I decided to create application where you can choose in different framework, either zero or hero it will help you alot to visualize what framework will you choose.

## Installation
In your local machine
```
pip install -e .
```
In using Pip install
```
pip install plutonkit
```

## Why we need another project template
There are several template generator that is available public repository, but they lack of user control in favored of there likes.
- to have condition, for feature that you want and available in architecture.
- Custom template that makes this project unique.


## Roadmap
Currently we are in alpha phase had not reach 100% test coverage and some linter(due to feature I am currently in focused) but still committed to deliver the improvement if the tool.

## How to use the command
Structure of your command, should follow this format

in `command.yaml` 
```
