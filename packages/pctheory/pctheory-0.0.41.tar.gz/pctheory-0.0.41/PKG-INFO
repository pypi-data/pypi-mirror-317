# `pctheory`
`pctheory` is a Python library for using atonal music theory. It is useful for both computer-assisted composition in Python and analysis. Some of the many useful features include:
- Set-classes
    - Generate all abstract subsets of a set-class
    - Get Forte and Carter names for a set-class
    - Work with microtonal sets
    - Generate set-class-complexes
- Rows
    - Generate a twelve-tone matrix
    - Generate a rotational array
    - Generate an invariance matrix
    - Load a random all-interval, all-trichord, ten-trichord, or Babbit ten-trichord row
    
`pctheory` is much more specialized than `music21`, and offers substantially more functionality in atonal theory. Additionally, it does not use `music21` objects, so there is less computational overhead when using `pctheory`. It is not difficult to create `music21` objects from `pctheory` objects, which allows `pctheory` to be used along with `music21`.

## Installation
`pctheory` is a Python package and can be installed with the command `pip install pctheory` from the terminal on your computer (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on Linux or macOS). Note that you need Python 3.10 or newer.

## Quick start
To create ordered or unordered collections (like pitch-class sets and twelve-tone rows), you use basic Python data structures like `set` and `list`. You can then add `pctheory.pitch.PitchClass` objects. To work with set-classes, you create a `pctheory.pcset.SetClass` object.

## System Requirements
`pctheory` requires Python 3.10 or newer.
