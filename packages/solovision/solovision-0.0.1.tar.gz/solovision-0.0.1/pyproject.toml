# Overview:
# This pyproject.toml file manages the build, packaging, and distribution of the Solovision library.
# It defines essential project metadata, dependencies, and settings used to develop and deploy the library.

# Installation:
# The Solovision library can be installed using the command: 'pip install solovision'
# For development purposes, you can install the package in editable mode with: 'poetry install'
# This approach allows for real-time code modifications without the need for re-installation.
