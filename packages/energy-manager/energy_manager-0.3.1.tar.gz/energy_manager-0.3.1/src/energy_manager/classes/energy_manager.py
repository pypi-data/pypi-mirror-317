class EnergyManager(object):
    """
    Manages energy consumption and calculates expenses based on provided parameters.

    This class is designed to handle energy management by leveraging data like
    city name, average energy usage, temperature, and insulation factor. It interacts
    with external APIs to compute daily energy expenses, taking into consideration
    climatic and usage factors.

    Attributes:
        _city_name (str): The name of the city for which energy expenses are calculated.
        _dpe_usage (float): The average energy usage (DPE - Diagnostic de Performance
            Énergétique) of the property in kWh/m².year.
        _temperature (float): The current temperature in the city, used for expense calculations.
        _openweathermap_api_key (str): API key for accessing OpenWeatherMap's forecast data.
        _insulation_factor (float): Adjustment factor accounting for the property's insulation
            efficiency. Defaults to 1.0, corresponding to standard insulation.
