---
Many default filters was provided for:

- auto matching EPG
- auto matching logos
- cleaning stream names
- grouping streams
- hide groups
- and many others filters

The full filter list is located [here](pliptv/pl_filters)

All filters are configurable by a configuration file. An example of this file is located [here](data/config_playlist.yaml)

## Examples

```bash
pip install xplcli
# or docker version
docker run --rm -e "PL=$PL" -v "${PWD}:/data" synker/xpl:latest
```

## TODO

- [ ] Enhancing reporting by filter
- [ ] Enhancing tests
- [ ] Enhancing playlist export (gist, azure, etc...)
- [ ] Ability to execute an external (remote) filter from url
- [ ] add github action pipeline for code analysis (PR)
