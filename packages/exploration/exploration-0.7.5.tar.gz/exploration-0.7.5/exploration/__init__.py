- Purpose: Represent & process exploration traces of discrete decision
    spaces.

Exploration contains sub-packages for dealing with exploration traces as
sequences of decision graphs (see `exploration.core`) and as journals
(see `exploration.journal`), and this version contains nascent code for
dealing with open-world exploration in terms of geographic features (see
`geographic.py`). See ../README.md (or
[https://pypi.org/project/exploration/](https://pypi.org/project/exploration/))
for project README.
