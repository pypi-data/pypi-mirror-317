- Authors: Peter Mawhorter

- Date: 2022-9-4
- Purpose: Parsing for journal-format exploration records.

A journal fundamentally consists of a number of lines detailing
decisions reached, options observed, and options chosen. Other
information like enemies fought, items acquired, or general comments may
also be present.

The start of each line is a single letter that determines the entry
type, and remaining parts of that line separated by whitespace determine
the specifics of that entry. Indentation is allowed and ignored; its
suggested use is to indicate which entries apply to previous entries
(e.g., tags, annotations, effects, and requirements).

The `convertJournal` function converts a journal string into a
`core.DiscreteExploration` object, or adds to an existing exploration
object if one is specified.

To support slightly different journal formats, a `Format` dictionary is
used to define the exact notation used for various things.

One of the types of entries that can be present in a journal. These can
be written out long form, or abbreviated using a single letter (see
`DEFAULT_FORMAT`). Each journal line is either an entry or a continuation
of a previous entry. The available types are:

- 'P' / 'preference': Followed by a setting name and value, controls
    global preferences for journal processing.

- '=' / 'alias': Followed by zero or more words and then a block of
    commands, this establishes an alias that can be used as a custom
    command. Within the command block, curly braces surrounding a word
    will be replaced by the argument in the same position that that word
    appears following the alias (for example, an alias defined using:

        = redDoor name [
          o {name}
            qb red
        ]

    could be referenced using:

        > redDoor door

    and that reference would be equivalent to:

        o door
          qb red

    To help aliases be more flexible, if '_' is referenced between curly
    braces (or '_' followed by an integer), it will be substituted with
    an underscore followed by a unique number (these numbers will count
    up with each such reference used by a specific `JournalObserver`
    object). References within each alias substitution which are
    suffixed with the same digit (or which are unsuffixed) will get the
    same value. So for example, an alias:

        = savePoint [
          o {_}
          x {_} {_1} {_2}
              gt toSavePoint
          a save
            At save
          t {_2}
        ]

    when deployed twice like this:

        > savePoint
        > savePoint

    might translate to:

        o _17
        x _17 _18 _19
            g savePoint
        a save
          At save
        t _19
        o _20
        x _20 _21 _22
            g savePoint
        a save
          At save
        t _22

- '>' / 'custom': Re-uses the code from a previously-defined alias. This
    command type is followed by an alias name and then one argument for
    each parameter of the named alias (see above for examples).

- '?' / 'DEBUG': Prints out debugging information when executed. See
    `DebugAction` for the possible argument values and `doDebug` for
    more information on what they mean.

- 'S" / 'START': Names the starting decision (or zone::decision pair).
    Must appear first except in journal fragments.

- 'x' / 'explore': Names a transition taken and the decision (or
    new-zone::decision) reached as a result, possibly with a name for
    the reciprocal transition which is created. Use 'zone' afterwards to
    swap around zones above level 0.

- 'r' / 'return': Names a transition taken and decision returned to,
    connecting a transition which previously connected to an unexplored
    area back to a known decision instead. May also include a reciprocal
    name.

- 'a' / 'action': Names an action taken at the current decision and may
    include effects and/or requirements. Use to declare a new action
    (including transforming what was thought to be a transition into an
    action). Use 'retrace' instead (preferably with the 'actionPart'
    part) to re-activate an existing action.

- 't' / 'retrace': Names a transition taken, where the destination is
    already explored. Works for actoins as well when 'actionPart' is
    specified, but it will raise an error if the type of transition
    (normal vs. action) doesn't match thid specifier.

- 'w' / 'wait': indicates a step of exploration where no transition is
    taken. You can use 'A' afterwards to apply effects in order to
    represent events that happen outside of player control. Use 'action'
    instead for player-initiated effects.

- 'p' / 'warp': Names a new decision (or zone::decision) to be at, but
    without adding a transition there from the previous decision. If no
    zone name is provided but the destination is a novel decision, it
    will be placed into the same zones as the origin.

- 'o' / 'observe': Names a transition observed from the current
    decision, or a transition plus destination if the destination is
    known, or a transition plus destination plus reciprocal if
    reciprocal information is also available. Observations don't create
    exploration steps.

- 'E' / 'END': Names an ending which is reached from the current
    decision via a new automatically-named transition.

- 'm' / 'mechanism': names a new mechanism at the current decision and
    puts it in a starting state.

- 'q' / 'requirement': Specifies a requirement to apply to the
    most-recently-defined transition or its reciprocal.

- 'e' / 'effect': Specifies a `base.Consequence` that gets added to the
    consequence for the currently-relevant transition (or its reciprocal
    or both if `reciprocalPart` or `bothPart` is used). The remainder of
    the line (and/or the next few lines) should be parsable using
    `ParseFormat.parseConsequence`, or if not, using
    `ParseFormat.parseEffect` for a single effect.

- 'A' / 'apply': Specifies an effect to be immediately applied to the
    current state, relative to the most-recently-taken or -defined
    transition. If a 'transitionPart' or 'reciprocalPart' target
    specifier is included, the effect will also be recorded as an effect
    in the current active `core.Consequence` context for the most recent
    transition or reciprocal, but otherwise it will just be applied
    without being stored in the graph. Note that effects which are
    hidden until activated should have their 'hidden' property set to
    `True`, regardless of whether they're added to the graph before or
    after the transition they are associated with. Also, certain effects
    like 'bounce' cannot be applied retroactively.

- 'g' / 'tag': Applies one or more tags to the current exploration step,
    or to the current decision if 'decisionPart' is specified, or to
    either the most-recently-taken transition or its reciprocal if
    'transitionPart' or 'reciprocalPart' is specified. May also tag a
    zone by using 'zonePart'. Tags may have values associated with them;
    without a value provided the default value is the number 1.

- 'n' / 'annotate': Like 'tag' but applies an annotation, which is just a
    piece of text attached to. Certain annotations will trigger checks of
    various exploration state when applied to a step, and will emit
    warnings if the checks fail.Step annotations which begin with:
        * 'at:' - checks that the current primary decision matches the
            decision identified by the rest of the annotation.
        * 'active:' - checks that a decision is currently in the active
            decision set.
        * 'has:' - checks that the player has a specific amount of a
            certain token (write 'token*amount' after 'has:', as in "has:
            coins*3"). Will fail if the player doesn't have that amount,
            including if they have more.
        * 'level:' - checks that the level of the named skill matches a
            specific level (write 'skill^level', as in "level:
            bossFight^3"). This does not allow you to check
            `SkillCombination` effective levels; just individual skill
            levels.
        * 'can:' - checks that a requirement (parsed using
            `ParseFormat.parseRequirement`) is satisfied.
        * 'state:' - checks that a mechanism is in a certain state (write
            'mechanism:state', as in "level: doors:open").
        * 'exists:' - checks that a decision exists.

- 'c' / 'context': Specifies either 'commonContext' or the name of a
    specific focal context to activate. Focal contexts represent things
    like multiple characters or teams, and by default capabilities,
    tokens, and skills are all tied to a specific focal context. If the
    name given is anything other than the 'commonContext' value then
    that context will be swapped to active (and created as a blank
    context if necessary). TODO: THIS

- 'd' / 'domain': Specifies a domain name, swapping to that domain as
    the current domain, and setting it as an active domain in the
    current `core.FocalContext`. This does not de-activate other
    domains, but the journal has a notion of a single 'current' domain
    that entries will be applied to. If no focal point has been
    specified and we swap into a plural-focalized domain, the
    alphabetically-first focal point within that domain will be
    selected, but focal points for each domain are remembered when
    swapping back. Use the 'notApplicable' value after a domain name to
    deactivate that domain. Any other value after a domain name must be
    one of the 'focalizeSingular', 'focalizePlural', or
    'focalizeSpreading' values to indicate that the domain uses that
    type of focalization. These should only be used when a domain is
    created, you cannot change the focalization type of a domain after
    creation. If no focalization type is given along with a new domain
    name, singular focalization will be used for that domain. If no
    domain is specified before performing the first action of an
    exploration, the `core.DEFAULT_DOMAIN` with singular focalization
    will be set up. TODO: THIS

- 'f' / 'focus': Specifies a `core.FocalPointName` for the specific
    focal point that should be acted on by subsequent journal entries in
    a plural-focalized domain. Focal points represent things like
    individual units in a game where you have multiple units to control.

    May also specify a domain followed by a focal point name to change
    the focal point in a domain other than the current domain.

- 'z' / 'zone': Specifies a zone name and a level (via extra `zonePart`
    characters) that will replace the current zone at the given
    hierarchy level for the current decision. This is done using the
    `core.DiscreteExploration.reZone` method.

- 'u' / 'unify': Specifies a decision with which the current decision
    will be unified (or two decisions that will be unified with each
    other), merging their transitions. The name of the merged decision
    is the name of the second decision specified (or the only decision
    specified when merging the current decision). Can instead target a
    transition or reciprocal to merge (which must be at the current
    decision), although the transition to merge with must either lead to
    the same destination or lead to an unknown destination (which will
    then be merged with the transition's destination). Any transitions
    between the two merged decisions will remain as actions at the new
    decision.

- 'v' / 'obviate': Specifies a transition at the current decision and a
    decision that it links to and updates that information, without
    actually crossing the transition. The reciprocal transition must
    also be specified, although one will be created if it didn't already
    exist. If the reciprocal does already exist, it must lead to an
    unknown decision.

- 'X' / 'extinguish': Deletes an transition at the current decision. If it
    leads to an unknown decision which is not otherwise connected to
    anything, this will also delete that decision (even if it already
    has tags or annotations or the like). Can also be used (with a
    decision target) to delete a decision, which will delete all
    transitions touching that decision. Note that usually, 'unify' is
    easier to manage than extinguish for manipulating decisions.

- 'C' / 'complicate': Takes a transition between two confirmed decisions
    and adds a new confirmed decision in the middle of it. The old ends
    of the transition both connect to the new decision, and new names are
    given to their new reciprocals. Does not change the player's
    position.

- '.' / 'status': Sets the exploration status of the current decision
    (argument should be a `base.ExplorationStatus`). Without an
    argument, sets the status to 'explored'. When 'unfinishedPart' is
    given as a target specifier (once or twice), this instead prevents
    the decision from being automatically marked as 'explored' when we
    leave it.

- 'R' / 'revert': Reverts some or all of the current state to a
    previously saved state. Saving happens via the 'save' effect type,
    but reverting is an explicit action. The first argument names the
    save slot to revert to, while the rest are interpreted as the set of
    aspects to revert (see `base.revertedState`).

- 'F' / 'fulfills': Specifies a requirement and a capability, and adds
    an equivalence to the current graph such that if that requirement is
    fulfilled, the specified capability is considered to be active. This
    allows for later discovery of one or more powers which allow
    traversal of previously-marked transitions whose true requirements
    were unknown when they were discovered.

- '@' / 'relative': Specifies a decision to be treated as the 'current
    decision' without actually setting the position there. Use the
    marker alone or twice (default '@ @') to enter relative mode at the
    current decision (or to exit it). Until used to reverse this effect,
    all position-changing entries change this relative position value
    instead of the actual position in the graph, and updates are applied
    to the current graph without creating new exploration steps or
    applying any effects. Useful for doing things like noting information
    about far-away locations disclosed in a cutscene. Can target a
    transition at the current node by specifying 'transitionPart' or two
    arguments for a decision and transition. In that case, the specified
    transition is counted as the 'most-recent-transition' for entry
    purposes and the same relative mode is entered.

"""
The different parts that an entry can target. The signifiers for these
target types will be concatenated with a journal entry signifier in some
cases. For example, by default 'g' as an entry type means 'tag', and 't'
as a target type means 'transition'. So 'gt' as an entry type means 'tag
transition' and applies the relevant tag to the most-recently-created
transition instead of the most-recently-created decision. The
`targetSeparator` character (default '@') is used to combine an entry
type with a target type when the entry type is written without
abbreviation. In that case, the target specifier may drop the suffix
'Part' (e.g., `tag@transition` in place of `gt`). The available target
parts are each valid only for specific entry types. The target parts are:

- 'decisionPart' - Use to specify that the entry applies to a decision
    when it would normally apply to something else.
- 'transitionPart' - Use to specify that the entry applies to a
    transition instead of a decision.
- 'reciprocalPart' - Use to specify that the entry applies to a
    reciprocal transition instead of a decision or the normal
    transition.
- 'bothPart' - Use to specify that the entry applies to both of two
    possibilities, such as to a transition and its reciprocal.
- 'zonePart' - Use for re-zoning to indicate the hierarchy level. May
    be repeated; each instance increases the hierarchy level by 1
    starting from 0. In the long form to specify a hierarchy level, use
    the letter 'z' followed by an integer, as in 'z3' for level 3. Also
    used in the same way for tagging or annotating zones.
- 'actionPart' - Use for the 'observe' or 'retrace' entries to specify
    that the observed/retraced transition is an action (i.e., its
    destination is the same as its source) rather than a real transition
    (whose destination would be a new, unknown node).
- 'endingPart' - Use only for the 'observe' entry to specify that the
    observed transition goes to an ending rather than a normal decision.
- 'unfinishedPart' - Use only for the 'status' entry (and use either
    once or twice in the short form) to specify that a decision should
    NOT be finalized when we leave it.

The entry types where a target specifier can be applied are:

- 'requirement': By default these are applied to transitions, but the
    'reciprocalPart' target can be used to apply to a reciprocal
    instead. Use `bothPart` to apply the same requirement to both the
    transition and its reciprocal.
- 'effect': Same as 'requirement'.
- 'apply': Same as 'effect' (and see above).
- 'tag': Applies the tag to the specified target instead of the current
    exploration step. When targeting zones using 'zonePart', if there are
    multiple zones that apply at a certain hierarchy level we target the
    smallest one (breaking ties alphabetically by name). TODO: target the
    most-recently asserted one. The 'zonePart' may be repeated to specify
    a hierarchy level, as in 'gzz' for level 1 instead of level 0, and
    you may also use 'z' followed by an integer, as in 'gz3' for level 3.
- 'annotation': Same as 'tag'.
- 'unify': By default applies to a decision, but can be applied to a
    transition or reciprocal instead.
- 'extinguish': By default applies to a transition and its reciprocal,
    but can be applied to just one or the other, or to a decision.
- 'relative': Only 'transition' applies here and changes the
    most-recent-transition value when entering relative mode instead of
    just changing the current-decision value. Can be used within
    relative mode to pick out an existing transition as well.
- 'zone': This is the main place where the 'zonePart' target type
    applies, and it can actually be applied as many times as you want.
    Each application makes the zone specified apply to a higher level in
    the hierarchy of zones, so that instead of swapping the level-0 zone
    using 'z', the level-1 zone can be changed using 'zz' or the level 2
    zone using 'zzz', etc. In lieu of using multiple 'z's, you can also
    just write one 'z' followed by an integer for the level you want to
    use (e.g., z0 for a level-0 zone, or z1 for a level-1 zone). When
    using a long-form entry type, the target may be given as the string
    'zone' in which case the level-1 zone is used. To use a different
    zone level with a long-form entry type, repeat the 'z' followed by an
    integer, or use multiple 'z's.
- 'observe': Uses the 'actionPart' and 'endingPart' target types, and
    those are the only applicable target types.  Applying `actionPart`
    turns the observed transition into an action; applying `endingPart`
    turns it into an transition to an ending.
- 'retrace': Uses 'actionPart' or not to distinguish what kind of
    transition is being taken. Riases a `JournalParseError` if the type
    of edge (external vs. self destination) doesn't match this
    distinction.
- 'status': The only place where 'unfinishedPart' target type applies.
    Using it once or twice signifies that the decision should NOT be
    marked as completely-explored when we leave it.

Represents a part of the journal syntax which isn't an entry type but is
used to mark something else. For example, the character denoting an
unknown item. The available values are:

- 'on' / 'off': Used to indicate on/off status for preferences.
- 'domainFocalizationSingular' / 'domainFocalizationPlural'
  / 'domainFocalizationSpreading': Used as markers after a domain for
  the `core.DomainFocalization` values.
- 'commonContext': Used with 'context' in place of a
    `core.FocalContextName` to indicate that we are targeting the common
    focal context.
- 'comment': Indicates extraneous text that should be ignored by the
    journal parser. Note that tags and/or annotations should usually be
    used to apply comments that will be accessible when viewing the
    exploration object.
- 'unknownItem': Used in place of an item name to indicate that
    although an item is known to exist, it's not yet know what that item
    is. Note that when journaling, you should make up names for items
    you pick up, even if you don't know what they do yet. This notation
    should only be used for items that you haven't picked up because
    they're inaccessible, and despite being apparent, you don't know
    what they are because they come in a container (e.g., you see a
    sealed chest, but you don't know what's in it).
- 'notApplicable': Used in certain positions to indicate that something
    is missing entirely or otherwise that a piece of information
    normally supplied is unnecessary. For example, when used as the
    reciprocal name for a transition, this will cause the reciprocal
    transition to be deleted entirely, or when used before a domain name
    with the 'domain' entry type it deactivates that domain. TODO
- 'exclusiveDomain': Used to indicate that a domain being activated
    should deactivate other domains, instead of being activated along
    with them.
- 'targetSeparator': Used in long-form entry types to separate the entry
    type from a target specifier when a target is specified. Default is
    '@'. For example, a 'gt' entry (tag transition) would be expressed
    as 'tag@transition' in the long form.
- 'reciprocalSeparator': Used to indicate, within a requirement or a
    tag set, a separation between requirements/tags to be applied to the
    forward direction and requirements/tags to be applied to the reverse
    direction. Not always applicable (e.g., actions have no reverse
    direction).
- 'transitionAtDecision' Used to separate a decision name from a
    transition name when identifying a specific transition.
- 'blockDelimiters' Two characters used to delimit the start and end of
    a block of entries. Used for things like edit effects.

        Given a string and a start index where a block open delimiter

class JournalObserver:
    """
    Keeps track of extra state needed when parsing a journal in order to
    produce a `core.DiscreteExploration` object. The methods of this
    class act as an API for constructing explorations that have several
    special properties. The API is designed to allow journal entries
    (which represent specific observations/events during an exploration)
    to be directly accumulated into an exploration object, including
    entries which apply to things like the most-recent-decision or
    -transition.

    You can use the `convertJournal` function to handle things instead,
    since that function creates and manages a `JournalObserver` object
    for you.

    The basic usage is as follows:

    1. Create a `JournalObserver`, optionally specifying a custom
        `ParseFormat`.
    2. Repeatedly either:
        * Call `record*` API methods corresponding to specific entries
            observed or...
        * Call `JournalObserver.observe` to parse one or more
            journal blocks from a string and call the appropriate
            methods automatically.
    3. Call `JournalObserver.getExploration` to retrieve the
        `core.DiscreteExploration` object that's been created.

    You can just call `convertJournal` to do all of these things at
    once.

    Notes:

    - `JournalObserver.getExploration` may be called at any time to get
        the exploration object constructed so far, and that that object
        (unless it's `None`) will always be the same object (which gets
        modified as entries are recorded). Modifying this object
        directly is possible for making changes not available via the
        API, but must be done carefully, as there are important
        conventions around things like decision names that must be
        respected if the API functions need to keep working.
    - To get the latest graph or state, simply use the
        `core.DiscreteExploration.getSituation()` method of the
        `JournalObserver.getExploration` result.

        this example; see `DEFAULT_FORMAT` for the default mapping from
        journal entry types to markers, and see `JournalEntryType` for
        the explanation for each entry type.

        for the type and possibly one for the target) followed by a
        single space, and everything after that is the content of the

        later using the 'custom' command, with parameter substitutions.

        If an alias with the specified name already existed, it will be
        replaced.

        Each of the listed parameters must be supplied when invoking the
        alias, and where they appear within curly braces in the commands
        string, they will be substituted in. Additional names starting
        with '_' plus an optional integer will also be substituted with
        unique names (see `nextUniqueName`), with the same name being
        used for every instance that shares the same numerical suffix
        within each application of the command. Substitution points must
        not include spaces; if an open curly brace is followed by
        whitesapce or where a close curly brace is proceeded by
        whitespace, those will be treated as normal curly braces and will
        not create a substitution point.

        For example:

        ... )  # _5 to show that the suffix doesn't matter if it's consistent
        >>> o.defineAlias(
        ...     'trade',
        ...     ['gain', 'lose'],
        ...     'A { gain {gain}; lose {lose} }'
        ... )  # note outer curly braces

        Deploys an alias, taking its command string and substituting in
        the provided argument values for each of the alias' parameters,
        plus any unique names that it requests. Substitution happens
        first for named arguments and then for unique strings, so named

        There are a few automatic arguments (although these can be

            the alias is deployed, NOT based on steps within the alias up
            to the substitution point.
        - '__hereName__' will substitute the name of the current
            decision.
        - '__zone__' will substitute the name of the alphabetically
            first level-0 zone ancestor of the current decision.
        - '__region__' will substitute the name of the alphabetically
            first level-1 zone ancestor of the current decision.
        - '__transition__' will substitute to the name of the current
            transition, or will generate an error if there is none. Note
            that the current transition is sometimes NOT a valid
            transition from the current decision, because when you take
            a transition, that transition's name is current but the
            current decision is its destination.
        - '__reciprocal__' will substitute to the name of the reciprocal
            of the current transition.
        - '__trBase__' will substitute to the decision from which the
            current transition departs.
        - '__trDest__' will substitute to the destination of the current
            transition.
        - '__prev__' will substitute to the ID of the primary decision in
            the previous exploration step, (which is NOT always the
            previous current decision of the `ObservationContext`,
            especially in relative mode).
        - '__across__-name-__' where '-name-' is a transition name will
            substitute to the decision reached by traversing that
            transition from the '__here__' decision. Note that the
            transition name used must be a valid Python identifier.

        - 'here': prints the ID and name of the current decision, or
            `None` if there isn't one.
        - 'transition': prints the name of the current transition, or `None`
            if there isn't one.
        - 'destinations': prints the ID and name of the current decision,
            followed by the names of each outgoing transition and their
            destinations. Includes any requirements the transitions have.
            If an extra argument is supplied, looks up that decision and
            prints destinations from there.
        - 'steps': prints out the number of steps in the current exploration,
            plus the number since the most recent use of 'steps'.
        - 'decisions': prints out the number of decisions in the current
            graph, plus the number added/removed since the most recent use of
            'decisions'.
        - 'active': prints out the names listing of all currently active
            decisions.
        - 'primary': prints out the identity of the current primary
            decision, or None if there is none.
        - 'saved': prints out the primary decision for the state saved in
            the default save slot, or for a specific save slot if a
            second argument is given.
        - 'inventory': Displays all current capabilities, tokens, and
            skills.
        - 'mechanisms': Displays all current mechanisms and their states.
        - 'equivalences': Displays all current equivalences, along with
