A type alias: Domains are identified by their names.

A domain represents a separable sphere of action in a game, such as
movement in the in-game virtual space vs. movement in a menu (which is
really just another kind of virtual space). Progress along a quest or tech
tree can also be modeled as a separate domain.

Conceptually, domains may be either currently-active or
currently-inactive (e.g., when a menu is open vs. closed, or when
real-world movement is paused (or not) during menuing; see `State`). Also,
the game state stores a set of 'active' decision points for each domain.
At each particular game step, the set of options available to the player
is the union of all outgoing transitions from active nodes in each active
domain.

Each decision belongs to a single domain.
"""

Zone: 'TypeAlias' = str

A type alias: A zone as part of a `DecisionGraph` is identified using
its name.

Zones contain decisions and/or other zones; one zone may be contained by
multiple other zones, but a zone may not contain itself or otherwise
form a containment loop.

Note that zone names must be globally unique within a `DecisionGraph`,
and by extension, two zones with the same name at different steps of a
`DiscreteExploration` are assumed to represent the same space.

The empty string is used to mean "default zone" in a few places, so it
should not be used as a real zone name.

DecisionID: 'TypeAlias' = int
"""
A type alias: decision points are defined by arbitrarily assigned
unique-per-`Exploration` ID numbers.

A decision represents a location within a decision graph where a decision
can be made about where to go, or a dead-end reached by a previous
decision. Typically, one room can have multiple decision points in it,
even though many rooms have only one. Concepts like 'room' and 'area'
that group multiple decisions together (at various scales) are handled
by the idea of a `Zone`.

are usually permanent, but may in some cases be temporary or be
temporarily disabled. Capabilities might also combine (e.g., speed booster
can't be used underwater until gravity suit is acquired but this is
modeled through either `Requirement` expressions or equivalences (see
`DecisionGraph.addEquivalence`).

By convention, a capability whose name starts with '?' indicates a
capability that the player considers unknown, to be filled in later via
equivalence. Similarly, by convention capabilities local to a particular
zone and/or decision will be prefixed with the name of that zone/decision

when a certain amount have been acquired).

When a key permanently opens only one specific door, or is re-usable to
open many doors, that should be represented as a `Capability`, not a
token. Only when there is a choice of which door to unlock (and the key is
then used up) should keys be represented as tokens.

Like capabilities, tokens can be unknown (names starting with '?') or may
be zone- or decision-specific (prefixed with a zone/decision name and
'::'). Also like capabilities, token names may not contain any of the

"""

MechanismID: 'TypeAlias' = int
"""
A type alias: mechanism IDs are integers. See `MechanismName` and
`MechanismState`.
"""

MechanismName: 'TypeAlias' = str
"""
A type alias: mechanism names are strings. See also `MechanismState`.

A mechanism represents something in the world that can be toggled or can
otherwise change state, and which may alter the requirements for
transitions and/or actions. For example, a switch that opens and closes
one or more gates. Mechanisms can be used in `Requirement`s by writing
"mechanism:state", for example, "switch:on". Each mechanism can only be
in one of its possible states at a time, so an effect that puts a
mechanism in one state removes it from all other states. Mechanism states
can be the subject of equivalences (see `DecisionGraph.addEquivalence`).

Mechanisms have `MechanismID`s and are each associated with a specific
decision (unless they are global), and when a mechanism name is
mentioned, we look for the first mechanism with that name at the current
decision, then in the lowest zone(s) containing that decision, etc. It's
an error if we find two mechanisms with the same name at the same level
of search. `DecisionGraph.addMechanism` will create a named mechanism
and assign it an ID.

By convention, a capability whose name starts with '?' indicates a
mechanism that the player considers unknown, to be filled in later via
equivalence. Mechanism names are resolved by searching incrementally
through higher and higher-level zones, then a global mechanism set and
finally in all decisions. This means that the same mechanism name can
potentially be re-used in different zones, especially when all
transitions which depend on that mechanism's state are within the same
zone.
TODO: G: for global scope?

Mechanism states are not tracked as part of `FocalContext`s but are
instead tracked as part of the `DecisionGraph` itself. If there are
mechanism-like things which operate on a per-character basis or otherwise
need to be tracked as part of focal contexts, use decision-local
`Capability` names to track them instead.

DomainFocalization: 'TypeAlias' = Literal[
    'singular',

    'spreading'

"""
How the player experiences decisions in a domain is controlled by
focalization, which is specific to a `FocalContext` and a `Domain`:

- Typically, focalization is 'singular' and there's a particular avatar
    (or co-located group of avatars) that the player follows around, at
    each point making a decision based on the position of that avatar
    (that avatar is effectively "at" one decision in the graph). Position
    in a singular domain is represented as a single `DecisionID`. When the
    player picks a transition, this decision ID is updated to the decision
    on the other side of that transition.
- Less commonly, there can be multiple points of focalization which the
    player can freely switch between, meaning the player can at any given
    moment decide both which focal point to actually attend to, and what
    transition to take at that decision. This is called 'plural'
    focalization, and is common in tactics or strategy games where the
    player commands multiple units, although those games are often a poor
    match for decision mapping approaches. Position in a plural domain is
    represented by a dictionary mapping one or more focal-point name
    strings to single `DecisionID`s. When the player makes a decision,
    they need to specify the name of the focal point for which the
    decision is made along with the transition name at that focal point,
    and that focal point is updated to the decision on the other side of
    the chosen transition.
- Focalization can also be 'spreading' meaning that not only can the
    player pick options from one of multiple decisions, they also
    effectively expand the set of available decisions without having to
    give up access to old ones. This happens for example in a tech tree,
    where the player can invest some resource to unlock new nodes.
    Position in a spreading domain is represented by a set of
    `DecisionID`s, and when a transition is chosen, the decision on the
    other side is added to the set if it wasn't already present.

class FocalContext(TypedDict):

    Focal contexts identify an avatar or similar situation where the player

    position information in one or more `Domain`s (see `State` and
    `DomainFocalization`). Normally, only a single `FocalContext` is needed,
    but situations where the player swaps between capability sets and/or
    positions sometimes call for more.

    At each decision step, only a single `FocalContext` is active, and the
    capabilities of that context (plus capabilities of the 'common'
    context) determine what transitions are traversable. At the same time,
    the set of reachable transitions is determined by the focal context's
    per-domain position information, including its per-domain
    `DomainFocalization` type.

    The slots are:

    - 'capabilities': A `CapabilitySet` representing what capabilities,

]
"""
Exploration statuses track what kind of knowledge the player has about a
decision. Note that this is independent of whether or not they've
visited it. They are one of the following strings:

    - 'unknown': Indicates a decision that the player has absolutely no
        knowledge of, not even by implication. Normally such decisions
        are not part of a decision map, since the player can only write
        down what they've at least seen implied. But in cases where you
        want to track exploration of a pre-specified decision map,
        decisions that are pre-specified but which the player hasn't had
        any hint of yet would have this status.
    - 'hypothesized': Indicates a decision that the player can
        reasonably expect might be there, but which they haven't yet
        confirmed. This comes up when, for example, there's a flashback
        during which the player explores an older version of an area,
        which they then return to in the "present day." In this case,
        the player can hypothesize that the area layout will be the
        same, although in the end, it could in fact be different. The
        entire flashback area can be cloned and the cloned decisions
        marked as hypothesized to represent this. Note that this does
        NOT apply to decisions which are definitely implied, such as the
        decision on the other side of something the player recognizes as
        a door. Those kind of decisions should be marked as 'noticed'.
    - 'noticed': Indicates a decision that the player assumes will
        exist, and/or which the player has been able to observe some
        aspects of indirectly, such as in a cutscene. A decision on the
        other side of a closed door is in this category, since even
        though the player hasn't seen anything about it, they can pretty
        reliably assume there will be some decision there.
    - 'exploring': Indicates that a player has started to gain some
        knowledge of the transitions available at a decision (beyond the
        obvious reciprocals for connections to a 'noticed' decision,
        usually but not always by having now visited that decision. Even
        the most cursory visit should elevate a decision's exploration
        level to 'exploring', except perhaps if the visit is in a
        cutscene (although that can also count in some cases).
    - 'explored': Indicates that the player believes they have
        discovered all of the relevant transitions at this decision, and
        there is no need for them to explore it further. This notation
        should be based on the player's immediate belief, so even if
        it's known that the player will later discover another hidden
        option at this transition (or even if the options will later
        change), unless the player is cognizant of that, it should be
        marked as 'explored' as soon as the player believes they've
        exhausted observation of transitions. The player does not have
        to have explored all of those transitions yet, including
        actions, as long as they're satisfied for now that they've found
        all of the options available.

    Given two (graph, state) pairs, as well as a set of reversion aspect
    strings, returns a (graph, state) pair representing the reverted
    graph and state. The provided graphs and states will not be
    modified, and the return value will not include references to them,
    so modifying the returned state will not modify the original or
    saved states or graphs.

    If the `revisionAspects` set is empty, then all aspects except
    skills, exploration statuses, and the graph will be reverted.

    Note that the reversion process can lead to impossible states if the
    wrong combination of reversion aspects is used (e.g., reverting the
    graph but not focal context position information might lead to
    positions that refer to decisions which do not exist).

    Valid reversion aspect strings are:
    - "common-capabilities", "common-tokens", "common-skills,"
        "common-positions" or just "common" for all four. These
        control the parts of the common context's `CapabilitySet`
        that get reverted, as well as whether the focalization,
        active domains, and active decisions get reverted (those
        three as "positions").
    - "c-*NAME*-capabilities" as well as -tokens, -skills,
        -positions, and without a suffix, where *NAME* is the name of
        a specific focal context.
    - "all-capabilities" as well as -tokens, -skills, -positions,
        and -contexts, reverting the relevant part of all focal
        contexts except the common one, with "all-contexts" reverting
        every part of all non-common focal contexts.
    - "current-capabilities" as well as -tokens, -skills, -positions,
        and without a suffix, for the currently-active focal context.
    - "primary" which reverts the primary decision (some positions should
        also be reverted in this case).
    - "mechanisms" which reverts mechanism states.
    - "exploration" which reverts the exploration state of decisions
        (note that the `DecisionGraph` also stores "unconfirmed" tags
        which are NOT affected by a revert unless "graph" is specified).
    - "effects" which reverts the record of how many times transition
        effects have been triggered, plus whether transitions have
        been disabled or not.
    - "custom" which reverts custom state.
    - "graph" reverts the graph itself (but this is usually not
        desired). This will still preserve the next-ID value for
        assigning new nodes, so that nodes created in a reverted graph
        will not re-use IDs from nodes created before the reversion.
    - "-*NAME*" where *NAME* is a custom reversion specification
        defined using `core.DecisionGraph.reversionType` and available
        in the "current" decision graph (note the dash is required
        before the custom name). This allows complex reversion systems
        to be set up once and referenced repeatedly. Any strings
        specified along with a custom reversion type will revert the
        specified state in addition to what the custom reversion type
        specifies.

class Effect(TypedDict):
    """
    Represents one effect of a transition on the decision graph and/or
    game state. The `type` slot is an `EffectType` that indicates what
    type of effect it is, and determines what the `value` slot will hold.
    The `charges` slot is normally `None`, but when set to an integer,
    the effect will only trigger that many times, subtracting one charge
    each time until it reaches 0, after which the effect will remain but
    be ignored. The `delay` slot is also normally `None`, but when set to
    an integer, the effect won't trigger but will instead subtract one
    from the delay until it reaches zero, at which point it will start to
    trigger (and use up charges if there are any). The 'applyTo' slot
    should be either 'common' or 'active' (a `ContextSpecifier`) and
    determines which focal context the effect applies to.

    The `value` values for each `type` are:

    - `'gain'`: A `Capability`, (`Token`, `TokenCount`) pair, or
        ('skill', `Skill`, `Level`) triple indicating a capability
        gained, some tokens acquired, or skill levels gained.
    - `'lose'`: A `Capability`, (`Token`, `TokenCount`) pair, or
        ('skill', `Skill`, `Level`) triple indicating a capability lost,
        some tokens spent, or skill levels lost. Note that the literal
        string 'skill' is added to disambiguate skills from tokens.
    - `'set'`: A (`Token`, `TokenCount`) pair, a (`MechanismSpecifier`,
        `MechanismState`) pair, or a ('skill', `Skill`, `Level`) triple
        indicating the new number of tokens, new mechanism state, or new
        skill level to establish. Ignores the old count/level, unlike
        'gain' and 'lose.'
    - `'toggle'`: A list of capabilities which will be toggled on one
        after the other, toggling the rest off, OR, a tuple containing a
        mechanism name followed by a list of states to be set one after
        the other. Does not work for tokens or skills. If a `Capability`
        list only has one item, it will be toggled on or off depending
        on whether the player currently has that capability or not,
        otherwise, whichever capability in the toggle list is currently
        active will determine which one gets activated next (the
        subsequent one in the list, wrapping from the end to the start).
        Note that equivalences are NOT considered when determining which
        capability to turn on, and ALL capabilities in the toggle list
        except the next one to turn on are turned off. Also, if none of
        the capabilities in the list is currently activated, the first
        one will be. For mechanisms, `DEFAULT_MECHANISM_STATE` will be
        used as the default state if only one state is provided, since
        mechanisms can't be "not in a state." `Mechanism` toggles
        function based on the current mechanism state; if it's not in
        the list they set the first given state.
    - `'deactivate'`: `None`. When the effect is activated, the
        transition it applies on will be added to the deactivated set in
        the current state. This effect type ignores the 'applyTo' value
        since it does not make changes to a `FocalContext`.
    - `'edit'`: A list of lists of `Command`s, with each list to be
        applied in succession on every subsequent activation of the
        transition (like toggle). These can use extra variables '$@' to
        refer to the source decision of the transition the edit effect is
        attached to, '$@d' to refer to the destination decision, '$@t' to
        refer to the transition, and '$@r' to refer to its reciprocal.
        Commands are powerful and might edit more than just the
        specified focal context.
        TODO: How to handle list-of-lists format?
    - `'goto'`: Either an `AnyDecisionSpecifier` specifying where the
        player should end up, or an (`AnyDecisionSpecifier`,
        `FocalPointName`) specifying both where they should end up and
        which focal point in the relevant domain should be moved. If
        multiple 'goto' values are present on different effects of a
        transition, they each trigger in turn (and e.g., might activate
        multiple decision points in a spreading-focalized domain). Every
        transition has a destination, so 'goto' is not necessary: use it
        only when an attempt to take a transition is diverted (and
        normally, in conjunction with 'charges', 'delay', and/or as an
        effect that's behind a `Challenge` or `Conditional`). If a goto
        specifies a destination in a plural-focalized domain, but does
        not include a focal point name, then the focal point which was
        taking the transition will be the one to move. If that
        information is not available, the first focal point created in
        that domain will be moved by default. Note that when using
        something other than a destination ID as the
        `AnyDecisionSpecifier`, it's up to you to ensure that the
        specifier is not ambiguous, otherwise taking the transition will
        crash the program.
    - `'bounce'`: Value will be `None`. Prevents the normal position
        update associated with a transition that this effect applies to.
        Normally, a transition should be marked with an appropriate
        requirement to prevent access, even in cases where access seems
        possible until tested (just add the requirement on a step after
        the transition is observed where relevant). However, 'bounce' can
        be used in cases where there's a challenge to fail, for example.
        `bounce` is redundant with `goto`: if a `goto` effect applies on
        a certain transition, the presence or absence of `bounce` on the
        same transition is ignored, since the new position will be
        specified by the `goto` value anyways.
    - `'follow'`: Value will be a `Transition` name. A transition with
        that name must exist at the destination of the action, and when
        the follow effect triggers, the player will immediately take
        that transition (triggering any consequences it has) after
        arriving at their normal destination (so the exploration status
        of the normal destination will also be updated). This can result
        in an infinite loop if two 'follow' effects imply transitions
        which trigger each other, so don't do that.
    - `'save'`: Value will be a string indicating a save-slot name.
        Indicates a save point, which can be returned to using a
        'revertTo' `ExplorationAction`. The entire game state and current
        graph is recorded, including effects of the current consequence
        before, but not after, the 'save' effect. However, the graph
        configuration is not restored by default (see 'revert'). A revert
        effect may specify only parts of the state to revert.

class SkillCombination:
    """
    Represents which skill(s) are used for a `Challenge`, including under
    what circumstances different skills might apply using
    `Requirement`s. This is an abstract class, use the subclasses
    `BestSkill`, `WorstSkill`, `CombinedSkill`, `InverseSkill`, and/or
    `ConditionalSkill` to represent a specific situation. To represent a
    single required skill, use a `BestSkill` or `CombinedSkill` with
    that skill as the only skill.

    Use `SkillCombination.effectiveLevel` to figure out the effective
    level of the entire requirement in a given situation. Note that
    levels from the common and active `FocalContext`s are added together
    whenever a specific skill level is referenced.

    Some examples:

    >>> from . import core
    >>> ctx = RequirementContext(emptyState(), core.DecisionGraph(), set())
    >>> ctx.state['common']['capabilities']['skills']['brawn'] = 1
    >>> ctx.state['common']['capabilities']['skills']['brains'] = 3
    >>> ctx.state['common']['capabilities']['skills']['luck'] = -1

    1. To represent using just the 'brains' skill, you would use:

        `BestSkill('brains')`

        >>> sr = BestSkill('brains')
        >>> sr.effectiveLevel(ctx)
        3

        If a skill isn't listed, its level counts as 0:

        >>> sr = BestSkill('agility')
        >>> sr.effectiveLevel(ctx)
        0

        To represent using the higher of 'brains' or 'brawn' you'd use:

        `BestSkill('brains', 'brawn')`

        >>> sr = BestSkill('brains', 'brawn')
        >>> sr.effectiveLevel(ctx)
        3

        The zero default only applies if an unknown skill is in the mix:

        >>> sr = BestSkill('luck')
        >>> sr.effectiveLevel(ctx)
        -1
        >>> sr = BestSkill('luck', 'agility')
        >>> sr.effectiveLevel(ctx)
        0

    2. To represent using the lower of 'brains' or 'brawn' you'd use:

        `WorstSkill('brains', 'brawn')`

        >>> sr = WorstSkill('brains', 'brawn')
        >>> sr.effectiveLevel(ctx)
        1

    3. To represent using 'brawn' if the focal context has the 'brawny'
        capability, but brains if not, use:

        ```
        ConditionalSkill(
            ReqCapability('brawny'),
            'brawn',
            'brains'

        ...     'brawny'
        ... )
        >>> sr.effectiveLevel(brawny)
        1

        If the player can still choose to use 'brains' even when they
        have the 'brawny' capability, you would do:

        >>> sr = ConditionalSkill(
        ...     ReqCapability('brawny'),
        ...     BestSkill('brawn', 'brains'),
        ...     'brains'
        ... )
        >>> sr.effectiveLevel(ctx)
        3
        >>> sr.effectiveLevel(brawny)  # can still use brains if better
        3

    4. To represent using the combined level of the 'brains' and
        'brawn' skills, you would use:

        `CombinedSkill('brains', 'brawn')`

        >>> sr = CombinedSkill('brains', 'brawn')
        >>> sr.effectiveLevel(ctx)
        4

    5. Skill names can be replaced by entire sub-`SkillCombination`s in
        any position, so more complex forms are possible:

        >>> sr = BestSkill(CombinedSkill('brains', 'luck'), 'brawn')
        >>> sr.effectiveLevel(ctx)
        2
        >>> sr = BestSkill(
        ...     ConditionalSkill(
        ...         ReqCapability('brawny'),
        ...         'brawn',
        ...         'brains',
        ...     ),
        ...     CombinedSkill('brains', 'luck')
        ... )
        >>> sr.effectiveLevel(ctx)
        3
        >>> sr.effectiveLevel(brawny)

          1 - 1/2**(1 + s - c)    if s > c
          1/2                     if s == c
          1/2**(1 + c - s)        if c > s
        }

    This probability formula is equivalent to the following procedure:

    1. Flip one coin, plus one additional coin for each level difference
        between the skill and challenge levels.
    2. If the skill level is equal to or higher than the challenge
        level, the outcome is success if any single coin comes up heads.
    3. If the skill level is less than the challenge level, then the
        outcome is success only if *all* coins come up heads.
    4. If the outcome is not success, it is failure.

    Multiple skills can be combined into a `SkillCombination`, which can
    use the max or min of several skills, add skill levels together,
    and/or have skills which are only relevant when a certain
    `Requirement` is satisfied. If a challenge has no skills associated
    with it, then the player's skill level counts as 0.

    The slots are:

    - 'skills': A `SkillCombination` that specifies the relevant
        skill(s).
    - 'level': An integer specifying the level of the challenge. Along
        with the appropriate skill level of the interacting entity, this
        determines the probability of success or failure.
    - 'success': A `Consequence` which will happen when the outcome is
        success. Note that since a `Consequence` can be a `Challenge`,
        multi-outcome challenges can be represented by chaining multiple
        challenges together.
    - 'failure': A `Consequence` which will happen when the outcome is
        failure.
    - 'outcome': The outcome of the challenge: `True` means success,
        `False` means failure, and `None` means "not known (yet)."

    """
    Given a `RequirementContext` (for `Capability`, `Token`, and `Skill`
    info as well as equivalences in the `DecisionGraph` and a
    search-from location for mechanism names) and a `Conseqeunce` to be
    observed, sets the 'outcome' value for each `Challenge` in it to
    either `True` or `False` by determining an outcome for each
    `Challenge` that's relevant (challenges locked behind unsatisfied
    `Condition`s or on untaken branches of other challenges are not
    given outcomes). `Challenge`s that already have assigned outcomes
    re-use those outcomes, call `resetChallengeOutcomes` beforehand if
    you want to re-decide each challenge with a new policy, and use the
    'specified' policy if you want to ensure only pre-specified outcomes
    are used.

    Normally, the return value is just the original `consequence`
    object. However, if `makeCopy` is set to `True`, a deep copy is made
    and returned, so the original is not modified. One potential problem
    with this is that effects will be copied in this process, which
    means that if they are applied, things like delays and toggles won't
    update properly. `makeCopy` should thus normally not be used.

    The 'policy' value can be one of the `ChallengePolicy` values. The
    default is 'random', in which case the `random.random` function is
    used to determine each outcome, based on the probability derived
    from the challenge level and the associated skill level. The other
    policies are:

    - 'mostLikely': the result of each challenge will be whichever
        outcome is more likely, with success always happening instead of
        failure when the probabilities are 50/50.
    - 'fewestEffects`: whichever combination of outcomes leads to the
        fewest total number of effects will be chosen (modulo satisfying
        requirements of `Condition`s). Note that there's no estimation
        of the severity of effects, just the raw number. Ties in terms
        of number of effects are broken towards successes. This policy
        involves evaluating all possible outcome combinations to figure
        out which one has the fewest effects.
    - 'success' or 'failure': all outcomes will either succeed, or
        fail, as specified. Note that success/failure may cut off some
        challenges, so it's not the case that literally every challenge
        will succeed/fail; some may be skipped because of the
        specified success/failure of a prior challenge.
    - 'specified': all outcomes have already been specified, and those
        pre-specified outcomes should be used as-is.


    In call cases, outcomes specified via `knownOutcomes` take precedence
    over the challenge policy. The `knownOutcomes` list will be emptied
    out as this function works, but extra consequences beyond what's
    needed will be ignored (and left in the list).

    Note that there are limits on the resolution of Python's random
    number generation; for challenges with extremely high or low levels
    relative to the associated skill(s) where the probability of success
    is very close to 1 or 0, there may not actually be any chance of
    success/failure at all. Typically you can ignore this, because such
    cases should not normally come up in practice, and because the odds
    of success/failure in those cases are such that to notice the
    missing possibility share you'd have to simulate outcomes a
    ridiculous number of times.

    file.

    """
    Given a `Situation` and a `Consequence` whose challenges have
    outcomes assigned, returns a tuple containing a list of the
    depth-first-indices of each effect to apply. You can use
    `consequencePart` to extract the actual `Effect` values from the
    consequence based on their indices.

    Only effects that actually apply are included, based on the observed
    outcomes as well as which `Condition`(s) are met, although charges
    and delays for the effects are not taken into account.

    `baseIndex` can be set to something other than 0 to start indexing
    at that value. Issues an `UnassignedOutcomeWarning` if it encounters
    a challenge whose outcome has not been observed, unless
    `skipWarning` is set to `True`. In that case, no effects are listed
    for outcomes of that challenge.

# Tags and Annotations #
#----------------------#

Tag: 'TypeAlias' = str
"""
A type alias: tags are strings.

A tag is an arbitrary string key attached to a decision or transition,
with an associated value (default 1 to just mean "present").

Meanings are left up to the map-maker, but some conventions include:

TODO: Actually use these conventions, or abandon them

- `'hard'` indicates that an edge is non-trivial to navigate. An
    annotation starting with `'fail:'` can be used to name another edge
    which would be traversed instead if the player fails to navigate the
    edge (e.g., a difficult series of platforms with a pit below that
    takes you to another decision). This is of course entirely
    subjective.
- `'false'` indicates that an edge doesn't actually exist, although it
    appears to. This tag is added in the same exploration step that
    requirements are updated (normally to `ReqImpossible`) to indicate
    that although the edge appeared to be traversable, it wasn't. This
    distinguishes that case from a case where edge requirements actually
    change.
- `'error'` indicates that an edge does not actually exist, and it's
    different than `'false'` because it indicates an error on the
    player's part rather than intentional deception by the game (another
    subjective distinction). It can also be used with a colon and another
    tag to indicate that that tag was applied in error (e.g., a ledge
    thought to be too high was not actually too high). This should be
    used sparingly, because in most cases capturing the player's
    perception of the world is what's desired. This is normally applied
    in the step before an edge is removed from the graph.
- `'hidden'` indicates that an edge is non-trivial to perceive. Again
    this is subjective. `'hinted'` can be used as well to indicate that
    despite being obfuscated, there are hints that suggest the edge's
    existence.
- `'created'` indicates that this transition is newly created and
    represents a change to the decision layout. Normally, when entering
    a decision point, all visible options will be listed. When
    revisiting a decision, several things can happen:
        1. You could notice a transition you hadn't noticed before.
        2. You could traverse part of the room that you couldn't before,
           observing new transitions that have always been there (this
           would be represented as an internal edge to another decision
           node).
        3. You could observe that the decision had changed due to some
           action or event, and discover a new transition that didn't
           exist previously.
    This tag distinguishes case 3 from case 1. The presence or absence
    of a `'hidden'` tag in case 1 represents whether the newly-observed
    (but not new) transition was overlooked because it was hidden or was
    just overlooked accidentally.

"""
Represents an action taken at one step of a `DiscreteExploration`. It's a
always a tuple, and the first element is a string naming the action. It
has multiple possible configurations:

- The string 'noAction' as a singlet means that no action has been
    taken, which can be used to represent waiting or an ending. In
    situations where the player is still deciding on an action, `None`
    (which is not a valid `ExplorationAction` should be used instead.
- The string 'start' followed by a `DecisionID` /
    (`FocalPointName`-to-`DecisionID` dictionary) / set-of-`DecisionID`s
    position(s) specifier, another `DecisionID` (or `None`), a `Domain`,
    and then optional `CapabilitySet`, mechanism state dictionary, and
    custom state dictionary objects (each of which could instead be
    `None` for default). This indicates setting up starting state in a
    new focal context. The first decision ID (or similar) specifies
    active decisions, the second specifies the primary decision (which
    ought to be one of the active ones). It always affects the active
    focal context, and a `BadStart` error will result if that context
    already has any active decisions in the specified domain. The
    specified domain must already exist and must have the appropriate
    focalization depending on the type of position(s) specifier given;
    use `DiscreteExploration.createDomain` to create a domain first if
    necessary. Likewise, any specified decisions to activate must
    already exist, use `DecisionGraph.addDecision` to create them before
    using a 'start' action.

    When mechanism states and/or custom state is specified, these
    replace current mechanism/custom states for the entire current
    state, since these things aren't focal-context-specific. Similarly,
    if capabilities are provided, these replace existing capabilities
    for the active focal context, since those aren't domain-specific.

- The string 'explore' followed by:
    * A `ContextSpecifier` indicating which context to use
    * A `DecisionID` indicating the starting decision
    * Alternatively, a `FocalPointSpecifier` can be used in place of the
        context specifier and decision to specify which focal point
        moves in a plural-focalized domain.
    * A `TransitionWithOutcomes` indicating the transition taken and
        outcomes observed (if any).
    * An optional `DecisionName` used to rename the destination.
    * An optional `Transition` used to rename the reciprocal transition.
    * An optional `Zone` used to place the destination into a
        (possibly-new) level-0 zone.
    This represents exploration of a previously-unexplored decision, in
    contrast to 'take' (see below) which represents moving across a
    previously-explored transition.

- The string 'take' followed by a `ContextSpecifier`, `DecisionID`, and
    `TransitionWithOutcomes` represents taking that transition at that
    decision, updating the specified context (i.e., common vs. active;
    to update a non-active context first swap to it). Normal
    `DomainFocalization`-based rules for updating active decisions
    determine what happens besides transition consequences, but for a
    'singular'-focalized domain (as determined by the active
    `FocalContext` in the `DiscreteExploration`'s current `State`), the
    current active decision becomes inactive and the decision at the
    other end of the selected transition becomes active. A warning or
    error may be issued if the `DecisionID` used is an inactive
    decision.
    * For 'plural'-focalized domains, a `FocalPointSpecifier` is needed
        to know which of the plural focal points to move, this takes the
        place of the source `ContextSpecifier` and `DecisionID` since it
        provides that information. In this case the third item is still a
        `Transition`.

- The string 'warp' followed by either a `DecisionID`, or a
    `FocalPointSpecifier` tuple followed by a `DecisionID`. This
    represents activating a new decision without following a
    transition in the decision graph, such as when a cutscene moves
    you. Things like teleporters can be represented by normal
    transitions; a warp should be used when there's a 1-time effect
    that has no reciprocal.

- The string 'focus' followed by a `ContextSpecifier` and then two sets
    of `Domain`s. The first one lists domains that become inactive, and
    the second lists domains that become active. This can be used to
    represent opening up a menu, although if the menu can easily be
    closed and re-opened anywhere, it's usually not necessary to track
    the focus swaps (think a cutscene that forces you to make a choice
    before being able to continue normal exploration). A focus swap can
    also be the consequence of taking a transition, in which case the
    exploration action just identifies the transition using one of the
    formats above.

- The string 'swap' is followed by a `FocalContextName` and represents
    a complete `FocalContext` swap. If this something the player can
    trigger at will (or under certain conditions) it's better to use a
    transition consequence and have the action be taking that transition.

- The string 'focalize' is followed by an unused `FocalContextName`
    and represents the creation of a new empty focal context (which
    will also be swapped-to).
    # TODO: domain and context focus swaps as effects!

- The  string 'revertTo' followed by a `SaveSlot` and then a set of
    reversion aspects (see `revertedState`). This will update the
    situation by restoring a previous state (or potentially only parts of
    it). An empty set of reversion aspects invokes the default revert
    behavior, which reverts all aspects of the state, except that changes
    to the `DecisionGraph` are preserved.

The different types of features that a `FeatureGraph` can have:

1. Nodes, representing destinations, and/or intersections. A node is
    something that one can be "at" and possibly "in."
2. Paths, connecting nodes and/or other elements. Also used to represent
    access points (like doorways between regions) even when they don't
    have length.
3. Edges, separating regions and/or impeding movement (but a door is also
    a kind of edge).
4. Regions, enclosing other elements and/or regions. Besides via
    containment, region-region connections are mediated by nodes, paths,
    and/or edges.
5. Landmarks, which are recognizable and possibly visible from afar.
6. Affordances, which are exploration-relevant location-specific actions
    that can be taken, such as a lever that can be pulled. Affordances
    may require positioning within multiple domains, but should only be
    marked in the most-relevant domain, with cross-domain linkages for
    things like observability. Note that the other spatial object types
    have their own natural affordances; this is used to mark affordances
    beyond those. Each affordance can have a list of `Consequence`s to
    indicate what happens when it is activated.
7. Entities, which can be interacted with, such as an NPC which can be
    talked to. Can also be used to represent the player's avatar in a
    particular domain. Can have adjacent (touching) affordances to
    represent specific interaction options, and may have nodes which
    represent options for deeper interaction, but has a generic
    'interact' affordance as well. In general, adjacent affordances
    should be used to represent options for interaction that are
    triggerable directly within the explorable space, such as the fact
    that an NPC can be pushed or picked up or the like. In contrast,
    interaction options accessible via opening an interaction menu
    should be represented by a 'hasOptions' link to a node (typically in
    a separate domain) which has some combination of affordances and/or
    further interior nodes representing sub-menus. Sub-menus gated on
    some kind of requirement can list those requirements for entry.

"""
The possible relationships between features in a `FeatureGraph`:

- 'contains', specifies that one element contains another. Regions can
    contain other elements, including other regions, and nodes can
    contain regions (but only indirectly other elements). A region
    contained by a node represents some kind of interior space for that
    node, and this can be used for fractal detail levels (e.g., a town is
    a node on the overworld but when you enter it it's a full region
    inside, to contrast with a town as a sub-region of the overworld with
    no special enter/exit mechanics). The opposite relation is 'within'.
- 'touches' specifies that two elements touch each other. Not used for
    regions directly (an edge, path, or node should intercede). The
    relationship is reciprocal, but not transitive.
- 'observable' specifies that the target element is observable (visible
    or otherwise perceivable) from the source element. Can be tagged to
    indicate things like partial observability and/or
    difficult-to-observe elements. By default, things that touch each
    other are considered mutually observable, even without an
    'observable' relation being added.
- 'positioned' to indicate a specific relative position of two objects,
    with tags on the edge used to indicate what the relationship is.
    E.g., "the table is 10 feet northwest of the chair" has multiple
    possible representations, one of which is a 'positioned' relation
    from the table to the chair, with the 'direction' tag set to
    'southeast' and the 'distance' tag set to '10 feet'. Note that a
    `MetricSpace` may also be used to track coordinate positions of
    things; annotating every possible position relationship is not
    expected.
- 'entranceFor' to indicate which feature contained inside of a node is
    enterable from outside the node (possibly from a specific part of
    the outside of the node). 'enterTo' is the reciprocal relationship.
    'entranceFor' applies from the interior region to the exterior node,
    while 'enterTo' goes the other way. Note that you cannot use two
    different part specifiers to mark the *same* region as enter-able
    from two parts of the same node: each pair of nodes can only have
    one 'enteranceFor'/'enterTo' connection between them.
- 'optionsFor' to indicate which node associated with an entity holds
    the set of options for interaction with that entity. Such nodes are
    typically placed within a separate domain from the main exploration
    space. The same node could be the options for multiple entities. The
    reciprocal is 'hasOptions'. In both cases, a part specifier may be
    used to indicate more specifically how the interaction is initiated,
    but note that a given pair of entities cannot have multiple
    'optionsFor'/'hasOption' links between them. You could have multiple
    separate nodes that are 'optionsFor' the same entity with different
    parts (or even with no part specified for either, although that
    would create ambiguity in terms of action outcomes).
- 'interacting' to indicate when one feature is taking action relative
    to another. This relationship will have an 'action' tag which will
    contain a `FeatureAction` dictionary that specifies the relationship
    target as its 'subject'. This does not have a reciprocal, and is
    normal ephemeral.
- 'triggeredBy' to indicate when some kind of action with a feature
    triggers an affordance. The reciprocal is 'triggers'. The link tag
    'triggerInfo' will specify:
    * 'action': the action whose use trips the trigger (one of the
        `FeatureAffordance`s)
    * 'directions' (optional): A set of directions, one of which must
        match the specified direction of a `FeatureAction` for the
        trigger to trip. When this key is not present, no direction
        filtering is applied.
    * 'parts' (optional): A set of part specifiers, one of which must
        match the specified action part for the trigger to trip. When
        this key is not present, no part filtering is applied.
    * 'entityTags' (optional): A set of entity tags, any of which must
        match a tag on an interacting entity for the trigger to trip.
        Items in the set may also be tuples of multiple tags, in which
        case all items in the tuple must match for the entity to
        qualify.

Note that any of these relationships can be tagged as 'temporary' to
imply malleability. For example, a bus node could be temporarily 'at' a
bus stop node and 'within' a corresponding region, but then those
relationships could change when it moves on.

    May be bundled with a direction indicator, although this can
    sometimes be inferred (e.g., if you're starting at a node that's
    touching one end of a path). For edges, a side-indicator may also be
    included. A destination-indicator can be used to indicate where
    along the item you end up (according to which other feature touching
    it you arrive at).
- 'cross' applies to nodes, paths, edges, and regions, and may include a
    destination indicator when there are multiple possible destinations
    on the other side of the target from the current position.
- 'enter' and 'exit' apply to regions and nodes, and indicate going

    'enterTo' relations are used to indicate where you'll end up when
    entering a node, note that there can be multiple of these attached
    to different parts of the node. A destination indicator can also be
    specified on the action.
- 'explore' applies to regions, nodes, and paths, and edges, and
    indicates a general lower-fractal-level series of actions taken to
    gain more complete knowledge about the target.
- 'scrutinize' applies to any feature and indicates carefully probing
    the details of the feature to learn more about it (e.g., to look for
    a secret).
- 'do' applies to affordances, and indicates performing whatever special
    action they represent.
- 'interact' applies to entities, and indicates some kind of generic
    interaction with the entity. For more specific interactions, you can
    do one of two things:
    1. Place affordances touching or within the entity.
    2. Use an 'optionsFor' link to indicate which node (typically in a
        separate domain) represents the options made available by an
        interaction.
- 'focus' applies to any kind of node, but usually entities. It
    represents changing the focal object/character for the player.

    being involved, such as when entering a menu.

class FeatureAction(TypedDict):
    """
    Indicates an action decided on by a `FeatureDecision`. Has the
    following slots:

    - 'subject': the main feature (an `AnyFeatureSpecifier`) that
        performs the action (usually an 'entity').
    - 'object': the main feature (an `AnyFeatureSpecifier`) with which
        the affordance is performed.
    - 'affordance': the specific `FeatureAffordance` indicating the type
        of action.
    - 'direction': The general direction of movement (especially when
        the affordance is `follow`). This can be either a direction in
        an associated `MetricSpace`, or it can be defined towards or
        away from the destination specified. If a destination but no
        direction is provided, the direction is assumed to be towards
        that destination.
    - 'part': The part within/along a feature for movement (e.g., which
        side of an edge are you on, or which part of a region are you
        traveling through).
    - 'destination': The destination of the action (when known ahead of
        time). For example, moving along a path towards a particular
        feature touching that path, or entering a node into a particular
        feature within that node. Note that entering of regions can be
        left implicit: if you enter a region to get to a landmark within
        it, noting that as approaching the landmark is more appropriate
        than noting that as entering the region with the landmark as the
        destination. The system can infer what regions you're in by
        which feature you're at.
    - 'outcome': A `Consequence` list/tree indicating one or more
        outcomes, possibly involving challenges. Note that the actual
        outcomes of an action may be altered by triggers; the outcomes
        listed here are the default outcomes if no triggers are tripped.

    The 'direction', 'part', and/or 'destination' may each be None,
    depending on the type of affordance and/or amount of detail desired.
