# Note: after adding openai-whisper and whisper-timestamped with poetry lock, I then removed all traces of triton
# from poetry.lock before running poetry install, as triton doesn't support macOS but isn't actually needed for whisper
# This was the only way I was able to get a working cross-platform build published to PyPI.
# To update the lockfile and install/upgrade dependencies, modify the dependency list above then run:
# poetry lock; patch -p0 poetry.lock <.github/removetriton.patch; poetry install
