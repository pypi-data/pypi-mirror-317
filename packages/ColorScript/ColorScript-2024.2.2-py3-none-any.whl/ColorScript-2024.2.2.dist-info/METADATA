# ColorScript Package

This is a simple yet effective package to manipulate ASCII and other codes in Python. 
More functionality has been added in later versions: Data has been added in version 0.0.6 and above.
- ASCII escape codes
- RGB codes for functionality not found in native Python
- Data
- Characters and functionality for strings and output

## How To Use
ColorScript is divided into two sections:
- data, and
- functions

Functions allow to manipulate text, while data has codes and other important data for manipulating text.

### Installation
You can install ColorScript with pip:
>pip install ColorScript

or you can go to https://pypi.org/project/ColourScript and download the .whl file or tar.gz file on Linux and open it.

**Note: You must have Python on your computer. You can install it at https://python.org**

### Testing
After you have installed it, you can import it into a Python file:
>from ColorScript import functions as cs #for importing functions
>
> from ColourScript import data as cd #for importing data

If you want to import both, type:
>from ColorScript import * as cs

or
>from ColourScript import functions,data as cs

After the module has been imported, you can use it, for example:
>cs.text.AliceBlue("Hello World") #function
> 
>x = cs.ANSI.codes.octal.COLOURS["GREEN"] #data

**Note that you have to explicitly type the colour you want the text to be, otherwise it will stay the same. For example if you type AliceBlue, all the text outputted in the future will be AliceBlue unless outputted as plain.**
