                          MY DOG ATE MY LICENSE   
                       Version 1, 18 December 2024


This should have been a proprietary software.
The most proprietary of them, even, the biggest of all,
except my dog ate my license.

If my dog didn't eat my license, everyone would have been forbidden from
copying , modifying , publishing , using or distribute this software for
free, be it in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose
commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.

I guess that I'll have to write another license now. For the time being,
and for an undefinite amount of time , you can do whatever you want with
this software , including everything the license that my dog eaten would
have disallowed you from doing otherwise.

THE  SOFTWARE  IS  PROVIDED  "AS  IS", WITHOUT  WARRANTY  OF  ANY  KIND,
EXPRESS  OR  IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT  NOT  LIMITED TO THE  WARRANTIES  OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR  A PARTICULAR PURPOSE  AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
IN  NO EVENT  SHALL  THE AUTHORS  BE LIABLE  FOR  ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES  OR
OTHER  LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION  OF CONTRACT, TORT  OR OTHERWISE,
ARISING  FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION  WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE  OR
OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

For more information, please refer to my dog.
