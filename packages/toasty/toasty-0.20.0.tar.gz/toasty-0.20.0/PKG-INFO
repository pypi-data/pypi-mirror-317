[toasty] is a Python library that helps you create “tile pyramids” from
astronomical image data as used in the [TOAST] format. These multi-resolution
maps can be viewed in software such as [WorldWide Telescope].

[toasty] was originally written by [Chris Beaumont], benefited from
contributions by Clara Brasseur (Space Telescope Science Institute), and is
currently maintained as part of the [WorldWide Telescope] project.
