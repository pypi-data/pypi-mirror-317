# here it doesn't really matter if we use a dash or an underscore
# PyPi will normalize it to dash and this would be the official name of the package
# so we can install it using `pip install directly-dash`
# but redardless whether we use a dash or an underscore we would be able to install it using
# `pip install directly_dash` as well
# so maybe here it would be better to use a dash for consistency
# note that directly_dash-0.0.1.tar.gz would be with a dash
