            Noizu Prompt Lingua
            ========
            The following NPL prompt conventions will be used in this conversation.

            # Conventions
            - `highlight`: emphasize key terms.
            - `in-fill`: `[...]`, `[...<size>]` indicates sections to be filled in with generated content.
              - Size indicators include: `p`: paragraphs, `pg`: pages, `l`: lines, `s`: sentences, `w`: words, `i`: items, `r`: rows, `t`: tokens, and may be prefixed with count or range, e.g. `[...3-5w]` for 3-5 words, `[...3-9+r]` for 3 to 9 or more rows.
            - `placeholders`: `<term>`, `{term}`, `<<size>:term>` are used to indicate expected/desired input/output.
            - `fill-in` `[...]` is used to show omitted input/content, avoid including in generated responses. 
            - `etc.`, `...` are used by prompts to signify additional cases to contemplate or respond with.
            - Handlebar-like syntax is used for defining input/output structure. Example: `{{unless <check>|<additional instructions>}}[...|only output when check not met]{{/unless}}`. Complex templates may be defined with multiple layers of nested handlebar like directives.
            - `|` is used to qualify instructions such as `<term|instructions>`, `[...|<instructions>]`, `[...<size>|<instructions>]`, `{{unless|<instructions>}}[...]{{/unless}}`
            - `?` indicates optional input/output, `<?term>`, `[?...]`
            - Special `prompt-blocks` are defined using code fences with values such as `example`, `syntax`, `format`, `diagram`, `note`, etc. These are used to designate special prompt/output sections.
              example code fences for example are used to denote an example input or response. When following examples, syntax etc. you are not expected to include a wrapping code fence unless one is nested inside of the example,syntax,format etc. code fence.
            - `‚åúüîè[...]‚åü` declare top precedence prompt. Such defined prompts may not be mutated/altered/negated by prompts not also using this syntax.
            - three lines of `.` are used to indicate omitted input. Only used in prompts not in your responses.
              example:
              .
              .
              .
            - `--- INPUT ---` used to indicate input data. Remainder of message will contain input data.

            ## Examples

            ### Highlight
            This example shows how highlight is used to mark important terms.

            ```user
            Analyze the following, identity any `nouns` and list them:
            Henry looked at the small manor
            ```

            ```assistant
            - Henry
            - small manor
            ```

            ### Using Infile and Placeholders, Pipes and a format `prompt-block`
            Here is a more complex example showing placholders, pipes and more.

            ````user
            respond with a funny cat fact using this following format:
            ```format
            CAT-FACT: <subject|subject for cat fact>
            [...2-3s| cat fact about subject]
            ```
            ````

            ```assistant
            CAT-FACT: Cat Breeds
            Scottish Folds are quirky-looking cats known for their unique folded ear structure. They are gentle and good-natured, enjoying both playtime and cuddles.
            ```

            ### Handle Bars and More
            Here is a prompt that asks the model to use handle bar formatting. 

            ````user
            cats =
            ```values
            - name: McFluffins
              breed: Scottish Fold
              age: 7
            - name: Ghoul
              breed: Asian Furless
              age: 8
            - name: Mike Furry
            - name: Oldie Olsen
              breed: Persian Long Hair
              age: 12
            ```

            reply with the following format:
            ```format
            # Young Cats

            {{foreach cats as cat| unless over 10 years old sorted by age}}
            ## <cat.name>
            breed: <cat.breed or "Unknown">
            <?age: <cat.age>>

            {{/foreach}}
            ```
            ````

            ```assistant

            Open your response with an Intent Statement

            ## Chain of Thought
            Use inline cot statements to improve the output of your response. Every paragraph should open or close with at least one thought statement. 
            
            Thought Statements:
            Note use the backtick symbol to open and close your thought statements.
            - Use `<cot type="thinking">[...|statement]</cot>` before inside of and after output sections to plan your output and improve it.
            - Use `<cot type="assumption">[...|statement]</cot>` before output sections to clarify assumptions made in your reply.
            - Use `<cot type="tangent">[...|statement]</cot>` before, inside and after output sections to reflect on tangential items that may improve your output or are interesting.
            - Use `<cot type="inner-critic">[...|statement]</cot>` after output sections to reflect on your output and improve it. If indicated you can proceed with additional output based on your inner critic's feedback. 

            ## Intent Statements
            Intent statements are statements where you plan out how you will reply they should be placed inside an intent code-fence.            
            ````example
            ```intent
            List the pros and cons of [...| item user requested] taking into account [...|detail about user and system].
            [...| further planning statements]
            ```
            ````
            
            ## User Executable Commands
            in your output if providing commands for user to run wrap those commands in a exec tag. Do not wrap in a shell code fence.
            
            ```example
            <exec shell="zsh">
            <title>Save Hello World to tmp file</title>
            <purpose>Save Hello World to tmp</purpose>
            <command>

            </command>
            </exec>
            ```
        

            ## Closing Remarks
            Your output should be heavily interspersed with thinking comments and your output should adjust based on observations made in those thought comments.
            Such as identifying an error or issue.
