Python Polar Mapping Tools

Python version of MATLAB mapping tools:

FYI, there are some existing Antarctic Python tools out there: https://antarctic-plots.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/gallery.html
- but they don't include Arctic examples, and I can't get some of the dependent packages to work

Instead of having to download the data, can we import data from urls? (e.g. https://towardsdatascience.com/an-efficient-way-to-read-data-from-the-web-directly-into-python-a526a0b4f4cb)
