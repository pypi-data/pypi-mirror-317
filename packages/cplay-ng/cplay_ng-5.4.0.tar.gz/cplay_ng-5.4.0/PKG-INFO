# Description

`cplay` is a minimalist music player with a textual user interface
written in Python. It aims to provide a power-user-friendly interface
with simple filelist and playlist control.

Instead of building an elaborate database of your music library, `cplay`
allows you to quickly browse the filesystem and enqueue files,
directories, and playlists.

The original cplay was started by Ulf Betlehem in 1998 and is no longer
maintained. This is a rewrite that aims to stay true to the original
design while evolving with a shifting environment.
