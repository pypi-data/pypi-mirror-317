# PyMDPs

PyMDPs is a Python library for working with Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and other related models like Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs). It is designed to be easy to use and flexible, with a focus on providing a clean and intuitive API for defining and solving MDPs.

## Features

- **Simple API**: PyMDPs provides a simple and intuitive API for defining MDPs and solving them using a variety of algorithms.
- **Modular Design**: PyMDPs is designed to be modular and extensible, making it easy to add new algorithms and features.
- **Well-Documented**: PyMDPs comes with comprehensive documentation and examples to help you get started quickly.
- **Open Source**: PyMDPs is open source and released under the MIT license, so you are free to use it for any purpose.

## Getting Started

For an introduction to PyMDPs and a guide on how to get started, check out the [Getting Started](getting_started/index.md) page.

To quickly install PyMDPs, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install pymdps
```
