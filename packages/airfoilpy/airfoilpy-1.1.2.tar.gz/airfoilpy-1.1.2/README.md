Overview

airfoilpy is a Python package designed for generating and manipulating airfoil shapes. While it currently offers only basic functionality, it is actively under development and will soon include advanced tools for airfoil analysis, optimization, and more.

Current Features

Generate NACA 4-digit Airfoils: Easily create geometries for common airfoils.

Save Airfoil Coordinates: Export airfoil shapes to a file for further use.

Future Plans

In upcoming releases, the package will include:

Support for higher-order NACA airfoils (5- and 6-series).

Tools for blending and morphing airfoil shapes.

Integration with CFD solvers for aerodynamic analysis.

Optimization utilities for aerodynamic performance
