# `inaSpeechSegmenter` API Models

This is common dependency for `inaSpeechSegmenter` [API](https://github.com/Danand/inaSpeechSegmenter-api) and [client](https://github.com/Danand/inaSpeechSegmenter-client). This client serves as a wrapper around the original `inaSpeechSegmenter` toolkit, providing a convenient interface for integrating its features into your own applications.

Please note that this project is not a direct fork of the original `inaSpeechSegmenter` repository. It is designed to work with the `inaSpeechSegmenter` API, utilizing the capabilities of the original toolkit as an underlying technology.

For more information about the original `inaSpeechSegmenter`, visit the [`inaSpeechSegmenter` GitHub repository](https://github.com/ina-foss/inaSpeechSegmenter).

## About `inaSpeechSegmenter`

- **CNN-based Toolkit**: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks for audio segmentation.
- **Voice Activity Detection**: Identifies active speech segments in audio.
- **Speaker Gender Segmentation**: Classifies speech segments by gender.
- **Multimedia Support**: Processes audio zones into speech, music, and noise.
- **Tool Integration**: Available as a Python package and Docker image.
- **Open Source Recognition**: Achieved top ranks in VAD challenges and used in gender representation studies.
