```sh
> shy -e "find . -type f -name '*.py' | wc -l"

🤖: This shell command uses `find` to search for files (`-type f`) with the extension `.py` (`-name '*.py'`) in the current directory (`.`) and its subdirectories.
The results are then piped to `wc -l`, which counts the number of line.
In conclusion, the command presents the total count of Python files (*.py) located within the current directory and its subdirectories.
