v1.0.3
======

Released on Mar 4, 2022 (`diff`_).

* Added feature for restricting HTTP methods: now only ``POST`` and ``PUT`` methods are allowed.
  We are highly recommend to use the ``POST`` verb for the generic JSON-RPC invocations,
  and the ``PUT`` verb generally for the notifications,
  but no one forbids using it for the generic invocations too.
