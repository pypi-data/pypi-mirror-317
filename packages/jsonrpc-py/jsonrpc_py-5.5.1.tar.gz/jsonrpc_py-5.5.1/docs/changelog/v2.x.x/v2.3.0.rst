v2.3.0
======

Released on Aug 28, 2022 (`diff`_).

* The common implementation of the :py:class:`collections.abc.MutableMapping` used
  by ``jsonrpc.Dispatcher`` and ``jsonrpc.WSGIHandler`` is moved to separate class
  for reducing source code size.
* Removed the ``Content-MD5`` header field calculation in the responses
  due the `security vulnerabilities <https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/836068>`_.
* Removed the ``Date`` header field calculation in the responses
  because it must be the responsibility of WSGI server.
* The :doc:`../../changelog` in the documentation has been reorganized.
