## How to use csv-to-custom-json

## Classic usage

Just import the function and use it !

```python
from csv_to_custom_json import parseFile

result = parseFile("myfile.csv")
```

## How to use the schema

Create a schema variable and put it as second parameter !

Example with a simple `csv` :

```csv
num1,num2,num3
1,2,3
4,5,6
7,8,9
```

```python
from csv_to_custom_json import parseFile

def callback(value):
    return None

schema = {
    "num1": "string",
    "num2": callback,
    "num3": "int"
}

result = parseFile("myfile.csv", schema)
```

> Caption :
>
> - ad you can see the schema can contains function, or string with the type
> - the values with type will be parsed
> - attribute of the object are the word in the first line of the csv

## More complexe schema

It's the same as a simple schema :

```python
from csv_to_custom_json import parseFile

schema = {
    "obj1": {
        "obj2": {
            "num4": "string"
        }
    },
    "num2": "",
    "num3": ""
}
result = parseFile("myfile.csv", schema)
```
