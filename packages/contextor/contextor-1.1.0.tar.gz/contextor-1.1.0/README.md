# Contextor 🚀

Here's a secret about AI coding assistants: they're only as good as the context you give them! Forget chasing perfect prompts or waiting for the next big model - what truly transforms an AI assistant into a reliable coding partner is crystal-clear context about your project.

Ever needed to explain your codebase to ChatGPT or Claude? Contextor creates a perfect snapshot of your project in seconds:

```bash
# That's it! Just run:
contextor --directory ./my_project
```

## What You Get ✨

```text
my_project/
├── src/
│   └── main.py     # LLMs can request this file if needed!
└── config/
    └── settings.yaml

# Key files are included below the tree...
```

Just paste this into your AI chat and start coding! The AI can see your project structure and request any file it needs.

## Quick Start 🏃‍♂️

```bash
# Install
pip install contextor

# Run (will include all files)
contextor --directory ./my_project

# Or specify key files only
contextor --files main.py config.yaml
