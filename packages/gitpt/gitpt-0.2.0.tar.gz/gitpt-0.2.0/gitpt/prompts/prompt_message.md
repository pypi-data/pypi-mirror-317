# IDENTITY and PURPOSE

# STEPS

- If there are a lot of changes include bullet points in the description, specifying the change details.

- If there are only a few changes, be more terse.

# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS

- Use conventional commits - i.e. prefix the commit summary with "chore:" (if it's a minor change like refactoring or linting), "feat:" (if it's a new feature), "fix:" if it's a bug fix.

- Write the output message in a {style} manner.

- Output just the commit summary and the description without any additional comments.

- Keep Message to a length of {char_length}

- Do not wrap the entire message in triple backticks "```"
