### **Background**
NOAA-Office of Water Predictions (OWP) use HAND FIM model for operational flood forecasting across CONUS (https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/inundation-mapping). It is a terrain based model that uses the Discharge and reach avergaed synthetic rating curves (SRCs) to generate the inundation and depth rasters at HUC-8 scale (Hydrologic Unit Code-8). The model is capable to produce flood maps less than a minute for all order streams within the watershed. The HUC-8 watersheds have catchment area more than 1000 sqkm , that makes this framework scalable and computationaly efficient. It is a fluvial flood model and doesnot have urban flood compponant.The last released version of the model is 4.5and has gone through significant improvements.The present notebook is user freindly and able to run the HAND FIM model from cloud and capable of running mutiple HUC-8s simulteniously.This model can run at any temporal resolution(hourly, daily, monthly etc).It uses the NHDPlus unique river identifiers and assign the streamflow for each of the segment. 

### **Package structures**
This version ([![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/sdmlua/fimserve)](https://github.com/sdmlua/fimserve/releases)) of code is available in fimserve 0.1.62 on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/fimserve/0.1.62/).

```
### **Usage**
To use this code, 

```bash
#Using pip
pip install fimserve

#OR add using poetry to your framework deployment
poetry add fimserve
```

Once it installed, import it like 
```bash
import fimserve as fm

#to download HUC8
fm.DownloadHUC8(HUC)    #Like this it contains multiples functionality.
```
Then there are a lot of different modules, call it to work. For reference to run, [Here (docs/code_usage.ipynb)](./docs/code_usage.ipynb) is the sample usuage of this code and different functionality.
