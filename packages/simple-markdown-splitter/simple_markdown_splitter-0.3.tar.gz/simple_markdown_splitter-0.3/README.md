# Simple smart-ish Markdown splitter Python library

A very simple Python library which allows splitting Markdown into chunks of text of a given length.

Chunks can be:
 - list entries - every paragraph in a list entry will be in the same chunk
 - code blocks
 - paragraphs split with single newline characters

Now you don't have to worry about malformed code blocks in your split messages!
