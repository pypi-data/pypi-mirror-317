Usage Example (Linear Regression)
Here's a quick example demonstrating how to use jackofalltrades for linear regression:
# Python
```import jackofalltrades as joft
from jackofalltrades.datasets import get_data

# Load data and split into training and testing sets
ldset = get_dataset()
X, y = ldset.get_btc()

# Train a linear regression model
model = joft.Models.LinearRegression(X, y)
model.fit()

# Make predictions and evaluate performance
y_predicted = model.predict(X)
model.evaluate(y, y_predicted)```
