pypimonitor ðŸ“ˆ Monitor your pypi packages
=========================================

    Unfortunately, due to a pypi bug, download statistics got from the json API are bogus. So some of the data displayed by this program (download badges, and line charts) are bogus tooâ€¦ This will be fixed when the pypi bug itself will be fixed.
    See for instance `#699 <https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/699>`_ and `#787 <https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/787>`_.
    
An HTML dashboard to monitor your `PyPI packages <http://pypi.python.org>`_. It
displays a line charts showing the evolution of downloads across versions, and
a set of badges (download statistics, `readthedocs <http://readthedocs.io>`__ badge,
continuous integration, etc.). See the example below.

|example|

.. |example| image:: http://pypimonitor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/spalax.png
   :target: http://spalax.frama.io/pypimonitor

It is available as a `command line interface <http://pypimonitor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module#pypimonitor-httpd>`_ that
generates the HTML code, and as a `web server <http://pypimonitor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module#pypimonitor-httpd>`_, to
generate and serve this dashboard.

See `changelog <http://framagit.org/spalax/pypimonitor/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md>`_.

What's next?
------------

This package replaces a static page that I manually updated from times to times. It does what I need, so there is little chance that I will develop it further. However, I see two directions this project could take:

- break everything, remove every single line of python code, and rewrite everything in javascript, so that this can be served as a static page (from the server point of view) that can be published using `gitlab pages <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/pages/README.html>`_ or `github pages <https://pages.github.com/>`_, `readthedocs <http://readthedocs.io>`__, etc., and conquer the world;
- or replace this quick and dirty web server using `your favorite web framework <http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks>`_, cache requests to the pypi API, publish it somewhere, and conquer the world.

I will do neither. But if you want to, you have my blessingâ€¦ :)

Download and install
--------------------

* From sources:

  * Download: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypimonitor
  * Install (in a `virtualenv`, if you do not want to mess with your distribution installation system)::

        python3 setup.py install

* From pip::

    pip install pypimonitor

* Quick and dirty Debian (and Ubuntu?) package

  This requires `stdeb <https://github.com/astraw/stdeb>`_ to be installed::

      python3 setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command bdist_deb
      sudo dpkg -i deb_dist/pypimonitor-<VERSION>_all.deb

Documentation
-------------

* The compiled documentation is available on `readthedocs <http://pypimonitor.readthedocs.io>`_

* To compile it from source, download and run::

      cd doc && make html
