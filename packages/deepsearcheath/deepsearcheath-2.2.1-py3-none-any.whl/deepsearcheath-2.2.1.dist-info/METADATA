If you're using Windows and trying to paste your token in the Command Prompt or PowerShell, 
    note that Ctrl-V and Shift+Insert won't work. 
Instead, you can use "Edit > Paste" from the window menu, 
    or enable "Use Ctrl+Shift+C/V as Copy/Paste" in "Properties". 
This is a known issue with Python's getpass module.

# How can I use API tokens to authenticate with PyPI?
API tokens are used to authenticate when uploading packages to PyPI.

You can create a token for an entire PyPI account, in which case, the token will work for all projects associated with that account. Alternatively, you can limit a token's scope to a specific project.

When using an API token from a CI provider, we recommend scoping the token down to the minimum necessary projects.

If you are publishing to PyPI from a CI provider that supports Trusted Publishing, we strongly recommend using Trusted Publishing instead.

To make an API token:

Verify your email address (check your account settings)
In your account settings, go to the API tokens section and select "Add API token"
To use an API token:

Set your username to __token__
Set your password to the token value, including the pypi- prefix
