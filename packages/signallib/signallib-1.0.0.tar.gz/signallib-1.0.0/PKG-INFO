> **signalLib** is a small, simple library for intergrating reactivity concepts like signals and observables.

## Installation

```bash
pip install signallib
```

## Getting Started

### Making Values Reactive

```python
from signallib import signal

name = signal('oarabile')

# this method takes in a function and
# when the value is changed, it passes
# the new variable into that function.
name.subscribe(lambda x: print(x))

# this is both our setter and getter
name.value = 'averylongnamecausewhynot'

# the "name" is printed onto the console
```

### Observing Changes To A Dict

```python
from signallib import observe

user = { "name": "oarabile", "age": 19 }

user = observe(user)

user.observer(lambda prop, value: print('The Prop Is ${prop}, and Value Of ${value}'))

user.name = 'john'

# we can even add custom properties
user.location = 'botswana'

# this is printed to the console ðŸ‘‡
# The Prop Is name, and Value Of john
```
