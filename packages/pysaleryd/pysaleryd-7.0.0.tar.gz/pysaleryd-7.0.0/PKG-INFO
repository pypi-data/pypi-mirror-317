    Python library for controlling Saleryd HRV system


Python library for controlling Saleryd HRV system using the built in websocket server used by Saleryd HRV Homeassistant integration https://github.com/bj00rn/ha-saleryd-ftx

Maintains a reconnecting websocket to the system.

Supported devices
==================

LOKE1/Loke Basic/LS-01 using control system 4.1.5

Example usage
=============================
.. code-block:: python3

    import asyncio

    from pysaleryd.client import Client
    from pysaleryd.const import DataKey

    def handle_message(data: dict):
        # must be safe to call from event loop
        print("message handler")
        print(data)

    async def main():
        update_interval = 10
        with Client("192.168.1.151", update_interval=update_interval) as hrv_client:
            hrv_client.add_message_handler(handle_message)
            await asyncio.sleep(update_interval +1 ) # wait around a bit for data
            await hrv_client.send_command(DataKey.FIREPLACE_MODE, 1) # turn on fireplace mode

    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(main())

Troubleshooting
===============
* Confirm system is connected and UI is reachable on the local network. Follow steps in the manual.
* Confirm websocket port by connecting to the UI using a browser and take note of websocket port using debug console in browser. 3001 is probably default
* The system HRV system can only handle a few connected clients. Shut down any additional clients/browsers sessions and try again.
