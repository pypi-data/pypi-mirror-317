## For each crystal, we consider 13 distinct conditions, categorized into three main aspects:
+ 1. Sample-related factors: average grain size, orientation effects, extinction
effects of symmetry, and deformation under internal stress. 
+ 2. Testing conditions:
atomic thermal vibrations at room temperature, air scattering noise, and instrumental vibrations. 
+ 3. Diffractometer-related factors: Distance between the detector and
sample, detector size, slit height, sample height, and angular zero shift.
