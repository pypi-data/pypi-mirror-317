# PAV√âS: Bajo los adoquines, la PLAYA üèñÔ∏è

The goal with **PLAYA** is just to get objects out of PDF, with no
dependencies or further analysis.  So, over top of **PLAYA** there is
**PAV√âS**: "**P**DF, **A**nalyse et **V**isualisation ... plus
**√â**labor√©e**s**", I guess?

Anything that deviates from the core mission of "getting objects out
of PDF" goes here, so, hopefully, more interesting analysis and
extraction that may be useful for all of you AI Bros doing
"Partitioning" and "Retrieval-Assisted-Generation" and suchlike
things.  But specifically, visualization stuff inspired by the "visual
debugging" features of `pdfplumber` but not specifically tied to its
data structures and algorithms.

There will be dependencies.  Oh, there will be dependencies.
