* Overview

bisos.graphviz ()

bisos.graphviz is a python package that uses the PyCS-Framework for processing
graphviz specifications in python.
It is a BISOS-Capability and a Standalone-BISOS-Package.

/bisos.graphviz/ is based on PyCS-Foundation and can be used both as a Command and
as a Service (invoke/perform model of remote operations) using RPYC for central
management of multiple systems.

* Part of BISOS --- ByStar Internet Services Operating System

Layered on top of Debian, *BISOS*: (By* Internet Services Operating System) is a
unified and universal framework for developing both internet services and
software-service continuums that use internet services. See [[https://github.com/bxGenesis/start][Bootstrapping
ByStar, BISOS and Blee]] for information about getting started with BISOS.\\
*BISOS* is a foundation for *The Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem* which is
described as a cure for losses of autonomy and privacy in a book titled: [[https://github.com/bxplpc/120033][Nature
of Polyexistentials]]

/bisos.graphviz/ is part of BISOS.

* bisos.graphviz is a Command Services (PyCS) Facility

bisos.graphviz can be used locally on command-line or remotely as a service.
bisos.graphviz is a PyCS multi-unit command-service.
PyCS is a framework that converges developement of CLI and Services.
PyCS is an alternative to FastAPI, Typer and Click.

bisos.graphviz uses the PyCS Framework to:

1) Provide access to graphviz facilities through native python.
2) Provide local access to graphviz facilities on CLI.
3) Provide remote access to graphviz facilities through remote invocation of
   python Expection Complete Operations using [[https://github.com/tomerfiliba-org/rpyc][rpyc]].
4) Provide remote access to graphviz facilities on CLI.

What is unique in the PyCS-Framework is that these four models are all
a single abstraction.

The core of PyCS-Framework is the /bisos.b/ package (the PyCS-Foundation).
See https://github.com/bisos-pip/b for an overview.

*  Uses of bisos.graphviz

Within BISOS,  bisos.graphviz is used as a common facility.


* bisos.graphviz as a Standalone Piece of BISOS

bisos.graphviz is a standalone piece of BISOS. It can be used as a self-contained
Python package separate from BISOS. Follow the installtion and usage
instructions below for your own use.

* Installation

The sources for the  bisos.graphviz pip package is maintained at:
https://github.com/bisos-pip/graphviz.

The bisos.graphviz pip package is available at PYPI as
https://pypi.org/project/bisos.graphviz

You can install bisos.graphviz with pip or pipx.

** Installation With pip

If you need access to bisos.graphviz as a python module, you can install it with pip:

#+begin_src bash
pip install bisos.graphviz
#+end_src

** Installation With pipx

If you only need access to bisos.graphviz as a command on command-line, you can install it with pipx:

#+begin_src bash
pipx install bisos.graphviz
#+end_src

The following commands are made available:
- graphviz.cs
- roInv-graphviz.cs
- roPerf-graphviz.cs

These are all one file with 3 names. _roInv-graphviz.cs_ and _roPerf-graphviz.cs_ are sym-links to _graphviz.cs_

* Usage

** Locally (system command-line)

=graphviz.cs= can be invoked directly as

#+begin_src bash
bin/graphviz.cs
#+end_src

** Remotely (as a service -- Performer+Invoker)

You can also  run


*** Performer

Run performer as:

#+begin_src bash
bin/roPerf-graphviz.cs
#+end_src

*** Invoker

Run invoker as:

#+begin_src bash
bin/roInv-graphviz.cs
#+end_src

** Use by Python script

*** bisos.graphviz Source Code is in writen in COMEEGA (Collaborative Org-Mode Enhanced Emacs Generalized Authorship) -- https://github.com/bx-blee/comeega.

*** The primary API for bisos.graphviz is ./bisos/graphviz/graphviz-csu.py. It is self documented in COMEEGA.

* Documentation and Blee-Panels

bisos.graphviz is part of ByStar Digital Ecosystem [[http://www.by-star.net]].

This module's primary documentation is in the form of Blee-Panels.
Additional information is also available in: [[http://www.by-star.net/PLPC/180047]]

** bisos.graphviz Blee-Panels

bisos.graphviz Blee-Panles are in ./panels directory.
From within Blee and BISOS these panles are accessible under the
Blee "Panels" menu.
