# Project
This is my simple python project, which does some simple stuff:
    - Logging
    - Sending data
    - Pinging
    - Getting data (passwords, ...)
    - Displaying notifications
    - Modifying strings
    - Checking connections
    - ...


## Functions
The package includes the following functions:
    {"\n".join("   - "+i for i in data["all"])}


## Settings
You can manage some things in the settings file of the project,
which is directly in the parent folder of it.


## Conclusion
This is a simple package for windows, which performs various tasks,
for that I am too lazy to do them. If you use this package
and do some silly stuff with it, I am not responsible for that!

If you have any questions, just join the discord channel:

However, this project is very simple, but effective.
