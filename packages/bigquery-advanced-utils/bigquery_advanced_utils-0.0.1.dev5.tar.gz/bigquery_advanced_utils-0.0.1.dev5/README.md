**BigQuery-advanced-utils** is a lightweight utility library that extends the official Google BigQuery Python client.  
It simplifies tasks like **query management**, *data processing*, and *automation*.  

Aimed at **developers** and **data scientists**, the project is open to *contributions* to improve and enhance its functionality.

For full documentation, please visit: [BigQuery-Advanced-Utils Documentation](https://alessio-siciliano.github.io/bigquery-utils/)

## Why This Library?

I created **bigquery-advanced-utils** because I often found myself facing complex or uncommon tasks when working with BigQuery, and there was little or no support available online. Rather than spending time reinventing the wheel, I decided to create this library to help others avoid the same challenges. I hope that everyone can contribute in the same spirit, so feel free to get involved and make this library even better!

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+

## Installation ðŸ“¦

### Install via pip (recommended)

Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install bigquery-advanced-utils
```
### Install in a Virtual Environment

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
2. Activate the environment and install:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # on macOS/Linux  
venv\Scripts\activate     # on Windows  
pip install bigquery-advanced-utils
```

## Usage Examples ðŸš€
### Quick Start

```python
from bigquery_advanced_utils.bigquery import BigQueryClient

# Initialize helper with your project ID
helper = BigQueryClient(project_id="your_project_id")

# Load data from CSV
helper.load_data_from_csv(file_path="your_data.csv")
```
### Data Validation
```python
test_functions=[
    partial(
        # Check if any null values exist in the "age" column
        b.check_no_nulls, columns_to_test=["age"],
    ),
    partial(
        # Ensure values in the "email" column are unique
        b.check_unique_column, columns_to_test=["email"]
    )
]
```
### Search by table or owner in Datatransfer
```python
from bigquery_advanced_utils.datatransfer import DataTransferClient

helper = DataTransferClient()
# Call the function with two parameters: owner email and project id
list_transfer_config_by_owner_email(owner_email="my-email@email.com", project_id="my-project")

# Get the scheduled queries by the name of a table (it's case sensitive) 
list_transfer_configs_by_table(table_id="my-table", project_id="my-project")
```

## Planned features ðŸš§
- A new query builder.
- Custom data transformation and processing functions.
- Exclusive features with datatransfer.
- Utility functions to manipulate strings and query.
