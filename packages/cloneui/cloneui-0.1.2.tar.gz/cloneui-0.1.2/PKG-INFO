# CloneUI

CloneUI is a Python library designed to clone a webpage into a structured folder format effortlessly. With CloneUI, you can easily download and save a webpage with its resources like images, CSS, and JavaScript files, organized in a folder structure.

## Installation

To install CloneUI, use pip:

```bash
pip install cloneui
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

Here is how you can use CloneUI to clone a webpage:

```python
from cloneui import CloneUI

# Provide the URL of the webpage you want to clone
url = "https://example.com"

# Download and save the webpage in a structured folder format
CloneUI.download_webpage(url)
```

### Functionality

1. **Cloning a webpage**: This function downloads the webpage and all its resources, organizing them into a folder structure that replicates the pageâ€™s elements.
2. **URL Support**: You can use any valid URL to clone the webpage.

## How It Works

CloneUI downloads the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files associated with the webpage. It then organizes these resources into a folder structure, making it easy to view and access them locally.

- The HTML content is saved in the main folder.
- CSS, JavaScript, and image files are placed in respective subdirectories.
- All resources are linked correctly to match the structure of the original webpage.
