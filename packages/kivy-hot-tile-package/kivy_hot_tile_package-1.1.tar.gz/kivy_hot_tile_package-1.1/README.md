## What is it?
<p>This project is a Hot Tile app made in Kivy(multiplatform, naturaly resizable framework for Python)</p>
<p>Video of this project: </p>

## How does it work?
<p>It is a really simple game. The player clicks on a tile and the text on the tile will show him the current distance of the tile to the winning tile.</p>
<p>It isnt simple though, as the tile moves one place in a random direction (diagonals included) after each guess.</p>
<p>The number of guesses depends on the size of the game grid.</p>

## Features
<p>Fully working grid with the tiles displaying both the distance in numbers and in colour.</p>
<p>A settings window with a setting for the grid size and for disabling the winning tile movement.</p>
