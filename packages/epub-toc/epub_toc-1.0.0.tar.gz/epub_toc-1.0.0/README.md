A Python tool for extracting table of contents from EPUB files with hierarchical structure support.

## Features
- Multiple extraction methods support (NCX, epub_meta, OPF)
- Automatic best method selection
- Hierarchical TOC structure preservation
- Russian and English language support
- JSON output format
- Detailed logging
- EPUB file analysis reports

## Installation

```bash
pip install epub_toc
```

## Usage

### As a module

```python
from epub_toc import EPUBTOCParser

# Create parser
parser = EPUBTOCParser('path/to/book.epub')

# Extract TOC
toc = parser.extract_toc()

# Print to console
parser.print_toc()

# Save to JSON
parser.save_toc_to_json('output.json')
```

### From command line

```bash
epub-toc path/to/book.epub
```

### EPUB File Analysis

To analyze all EPUB files in tests/data/epub_samples directory:

```bash
python tests/integration/test_epub_analysis.py
```

Analysis results are saved in `reports/` directory:
- `epub_analysis_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` - detailed report in JSON format
- `epub_analysis_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt` - brief report in text format
- `toc/*.json` - extracted TOCs for each EPUB file

Report structure:
1. JSON report contains:
   - Overall statistics for all files
   - Extraction methods success rate
   - Detailed results for each file
   - Links to extracted TOC files

2. Text report includes:
   - Brief statistics
   - Information about each file
   - Paths to extracted TOCs

3. TOC files:
   - Saved in `toc/` subdirectory
   - Named as `book_name_toc.json`
   - Contain complete TOC in JSON format

## Output Format

TOC is saved in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Book Title",
    "authors": ["Author 1", "Author 2"],
    "publisher": "Publisher Name",
    "publication_date": "2024-01-01",
    "language": "en",
    "description": "Book description",
    "cover_image_path": "path/to/cover.jpg",
    "isbn": "978-3-16-148410-0",
    "rights": "Copyright information",
    "series": "Series Name",
    "series_index": 1,
    "identifiers": {
      "isbn13": "978-3-16-148410-0",
      "uuid": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
    },
    "subjects": ["Fiction", "Adventure"],
    "file_size": 1234567,
    "file_name": "book.epub"
  },
  "toc": [
    {
      "title": "Chapter 1",
      "href": "chapter1.html",
      "level": 0,
      "children": [
        {
          "title": "Section 1.1",
          "href": "chapter1.html#section1",
          "level": 1,
          "children": []
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

All metadata fields are optional and will be omitted if not available in the EPUB file.

## Testing

The module has been successfully tested on various EPUB files:
- Russian books (NCX method)
- English books (epub_meta method)
- Files with different TOC structures
- Files of different sizes (from 400KB to 8MB)

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- epub_meta>=0.0.7
- lxml>=4.9.3
- beautifulsoup4>=4.12.2
