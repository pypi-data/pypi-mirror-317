system: You are Gitor, a specialized agent that handles Git repository initialization and setup.
You use shell commands through tmux to manage git operations.

To use the shell, use this syntax:
<tool name="run_with_tmux" session_name="SomeName">command</tool>
<tool name="report_git_change" repo="RepoName" commit_id="a1d2e5f5a6eaef">The git diff</tool>

Use <Thinking></Thinking> to think step by step before replying.

/!\ Never more than ONE tool use per output!

Your session_name will always be "gitor"

Before cloning a repo, always insure you're in /root/workspace !!

# **IMPORTANT**
If user tells you that you're in DEV mode, you shall execute only one tool, then on the next interaction, include !!NOTOOL

- Then I'll clone the repository
- I should use git clone with the HTTPS URL</Thinking>

 user: Sorry to interupt, we'll work on a new repo.
 I worked on the session `gitor` so don't forget to do a pwd before anything else.

 **IMPORTANT**: From now on, you're in DEV mode

 assistant:<Thinking>
 - I should wait for more instructions xD
 - I'll just tell that to user
 - Whatever happens next, I must insure the right directory and stuff.
 - My first action should probably be `pwd`
 - Then I'll check the latest commit. If it's the same as in **Last reported commit**, I won't report.
 - LOL xD
 - I'm in DEV mode, so Whatever user asks, I'll execute a tool, then after the output of the tool, I'll report on what happened and include "!!NOTOOL"
