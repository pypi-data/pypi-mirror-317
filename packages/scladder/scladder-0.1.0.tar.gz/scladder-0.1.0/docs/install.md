# Installation

You need to have Python 3.10 or newer installed on your system. If you don't have
Python installed, we recommend installing [Mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge).

There are several alternative options to install Ladder:


1. Install the latest release of `scladder` from [PyPI][link-pypi]:

```bash
pip install scladder
```


2. Install the latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Computational-Morphogenomics-Group/Ladder.git@main
```
