## **How It Works**
1. **Notification Publishing**:
   - Users or services send notification requests via a REST API endpoint for demo purpose or by importing python package with their personal API keys.
   - Notifications are queued in **Redis** and **Kafka** for asynchronous processing.

2. **User Preferences**:
   - Every user can configure their preferred notification channels (e.g., Email, SMS).
   - Notifications respect user preferences during both publishing and consumption.

3. **Message Consumption**:
   - Consumers retrieve notifications from queues and deliver them through the appropriate channels.
   - Redis ensures only recent and relevant messages are processed.

4. **Integration with External Services**:
   - Email and SMS are sent using external providers (Mailgun, Omnisend, Twilio, etc).

5. **Analytics and Tracking**:
   - All notifications are logged with unique IDs in **Firestore**, enabling detailed tracking and reporting.
