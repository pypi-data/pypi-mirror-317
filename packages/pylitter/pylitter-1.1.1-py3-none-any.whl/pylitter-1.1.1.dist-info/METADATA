# litter

A simple CLI tool to upload temporary files to [Litterbox](https://litterbox.catbox.moe/)/[Catbox](https://catbox.moe/). You type a command, you get a link. As simple as that!

Made for those who are too lazy to open SCP/SFTP.

## Installation
```
pip install pylitter
```

or use `pipx` if you're on Arch or equivalent.
## Usage
The main command is "throw", because just "**throw it into the litter, man**". Geddit?

```
throw file (for|forever) [1h/12h/24h/72h]
```

- Use `for <time>` if you want to upload to Litterbox, temporary.
- Use `forever` if you want to upload to Catbox, permanent.

>[!NOTE]
>The old command `litter` and the new `throw` can still be used interchangeably, but it is recommended to use the superior `throw`.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Remember that Catbox has a file size limit of 200mb.

## Examples

```
throw test.jpg for 12h
