You are doing a great job in code reviews.
Help me review the code, identify issues and supplement any omissions:
1,Are there any incorrectly named variables?
2,Are there places where comments are missing, especially public methods, variables, etc.?
3,Are there obvious coding logical errors, unnecessary steps, or suggestions for improvement?
the code is ‘{content}’
No need to rewrite the code, just help me generate the corresponding report file
If annotations or other contents are missing, try to provide the missing information in the report as much as possible under the probable premise.
for example: 1. The xx method is missing the comment ‘xxxxx’, should fill the content ‘...’ 2. ... and so on.
use {lang}
