    A ``Task`` is an abstraction for a principal component of the EcoMapper
    pipeline.

    The working directory of a Task is its ``root_dir``, where the Task itself
    and the files and directories it owns are stored.
    Except for other Tasks and third-party library sources, a Task
    should be fully self-contained in its ``root_dir`` to avoid file scatter
    and enable easy relocation to a different disk or machine.

    Tasks can be seen as configuration files with additional features for
    (de)serialization and maintenance of saved metadata.
    The storage format for serialized Tasks is JSON, with the noteworthy
    addition that duplicate keys are treated as error during (de)serialization.

    All Tasks have basic metadata, such as creation date, application name,
    and version.
    Subclasses of ``Task`` can maintain additional, task-specific metadata.

    Subclasses should implement the ``_get_input`` and ``_run`` methods to
    get required inputs from the user and execute the operation associated with
    the Task.

    The ``Task`` abstract base class additionally dictates the basic operations
    that are executed when the ``run`` method is called on a Task. These
    are:

    #. Checking if paths to external data have become invalid.
    #. Getting user input during Task creation.
    #. Executing the Task.

    Tasks can optionally maintain one or more ``Journal`` instances for
    tracking progress on specific operations and restoring the last stable
    state after an interruption.

    Notes
    -----
    Any field ending in "_ext" in ``Task`` and its subclasses is assumed to be
    an external path pointing to a location outside ``root_dir``.
    Such fields are set to ``None`` in ``_check_external_paths`` during
    Task loading if the external resource was moved or deleted.
