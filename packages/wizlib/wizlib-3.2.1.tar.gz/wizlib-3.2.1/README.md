# WizLib

A framework for command-line devops and personal productivity tools

WizLib wraps the built-in ArgumentParser with a set of functions, classes, and conventions that enables:

- Easy addition of loosely coupled new subcommands
- Unified access to configuration files with a normalized approach
- Standardized use of stdin, stdout, and stderr
- Plugin-type system for handling alternate UIs (such as curses or even a web UI)
- Usable completion support for user input
- Abstracts some of the argparse complexity
- Applies conventions to application code structure
- Supports test-driven development and CICD
