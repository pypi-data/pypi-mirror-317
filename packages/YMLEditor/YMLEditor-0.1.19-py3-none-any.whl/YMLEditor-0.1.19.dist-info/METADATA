# Readme

<img width="622" alt="sample" src="https://github.com/corb555/YMLEditor/blob/62749ffe58806449d0adba7040e1157ae4b184c2/images/YMLEditor.png?raw=true">

## Overview

`YMLEditor` is a package for easily creating editors for simple configuration files.  

## Features

**SettingsWidget** provides a Widget for displaying and editing config file fields. You
simply list the fields with their config key and the widget you want for each (line_edit, text_edit, label,
combo-box). You can also add a regex for data entry validation. The SettingsWiget and YamlConfig  will
read the config file, display the fields for editing, and then save the data.

- **Easy Front-End Creation:** Create a configuration editor with a few lines of code.
- **Configurable Layout:** Displays settings using the format you provide.
- **Widget Support:** Supports these QT widgets: text edit, line edit, combo box, and label.
- **Input Validation:** Validates input based on supplied regular expressions and 
highlights invalid entries. In the sample above, Tip Amount is highlighted because it contains letters.
- **Data Syncing:** Synchronizes data values between the UI and the config file, seamlessly using the
  ConfigFile manager described below.
- **Utilizes PyQt6**

**YamlConfig** provides functionality for creating, loading, updating, and saving YAML files using PyYAML.

- **Load / Save / Create** Provides interfaces to load and save YAML files and to create new YAML files.
- **Get / Set Operations:** Provides simple key/value access to data fields in the YAML configuration, including
scalars (int, float, str, bool, date), lists, and dictionaries.  _Complex  hierarchies are not supported._
- **Undo Support:** Keeps a snapshot for each save _in session_ and restores from stack.
- **Granular Dependency Management:** For build system integration, this can be configured to touch a proxy file 
when a specified field changes, offering more granular dependency tracking for build systems.

## Installation

To install `YMLEditor`:

```bash
pip install YMLEditor
```

### Format Layout

Each line in the format corresponds to a field in the config file:  
`ConfigKey: (DisplayName, WidgetType, Options, Width)`

- Config Key: The name of the item in the YAML config file
- Display Name: The name to show in the UI.
- Widget Type: The type of input control "text_edit", "line_edit", "label", "read_only", or "combo_box".
- Options: Either a regex pattern for field validation (e.g., line_edit), 
       or a list of items for selection (e.g., combo box).
- Field Width: Width of the widget in the UI.

### Sample layout format

```python
formats = {
       "layout1": {
              "TIP": ("Tip Amount", "line_edit", r'^\d{1,2}$', 50),
              "DESSERT": ("Dessert", "combo", ["Tiramisu", "Apple Tart", "Cheesecake"], 200),
              "HOME": ("Home", "combo", ["A", "B", "C"], 200),   
              "SITES.@HOME": ("Preferred", "read_only", None, 180),
              "SITES.B": ("Location B", "line_edit", None, 180), 
              "SITES": ("Sites", "line_edit", None, 300),
       },
}
```
- SITES.@HOME - If '@' is present, that key will be looked up and replace by its contents (SITES.C in this example)
- SITES.B - You can access sub hierarchies by using "." to separate keys (Boston in this example)
- TIP - The regex for Tips highlights entries that aren't simply 1 or 2 digits.

### Sample YAML file

```yaml
TIP: 18
DESSERT: Cheesecake
HOME: C
SITES:
  A: New Orleans
  B: Boston
  C: Vancouver
  ```

### Sample App

Sample.py is provided to demonstrate the capabilities of `YMLEditor` with a sample YAML file.
