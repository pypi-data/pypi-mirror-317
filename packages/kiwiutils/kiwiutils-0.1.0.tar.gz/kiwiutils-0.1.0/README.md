# kiwiutils
`kiwiutils` is a library for various general purpose utilities.
It was split from a module in the [lifelog](https://github.com/aaron-sandoval/lifelog) project, with a few other utilities I developed for [other projects](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset).

# Installation
```bash
pip install kiwiutils
```
