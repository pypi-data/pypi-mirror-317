        This function reads the configuration and steps of a curation workflow
        from a specified JSON file and reconstructs the workflow as an instance
        of `CurationWorkflow`.

        Loading will fail if there are conflicts between:
        - the version numbers of the workflow and the current installation
        - the final workflow hash doesn't match the hash stored in the JSON file
        - the workflow source-code hash doesn't match the hash stored in the JSON file
        - any of the curation functions steps are missing
        - any of the steps have a source code hash that doesn't match the stored hash

        This is alot of reason; specific exceptions for each one will be raised in the
        case they occur

        You can turn off this safety check by setting `safe` to `False`.
        IF you do this, the workflow will tag itself as unsafe, and any
        curation run using it will also be flagged as unsafe in the output
        curation report

        Generally, it should be enough to make sure all your versions for the
        programs match the workflow. If this doesn't fix it and your having source
        code mismatches still, it means you have either edited the source code, or
        whoever generated the workflow has edited the source code. You should reach out
        to whoever made it and see if they can provide you with more info.
