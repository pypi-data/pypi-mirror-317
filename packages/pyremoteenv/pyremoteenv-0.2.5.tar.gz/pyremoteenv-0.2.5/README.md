# pyremoteenv

---
`pyremoteenv` is a Python package that allows you to configure your application with environment variables loaded from a remote registry.

Currently, the supported backend is ZooKeeper, but it's easy to extend to support other backends.

---
## Installation

Install `pyremoteenv` using pip:

```bash
pip install pyremoteenv
```

The only supported backend is ZooKeeper. Install dependencies for it 
```bash
pip install pyremoteenv[zk]
```

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- [kazoo](https://kazoo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - For ZooKeeper support.

---

## Usage

```python
import os
import remoteenv

remote_env = remoteenv.Env('zk')
with remote_env:

     # Write to remote config
     remote_env.set('TEST', 'test')

     # Read from remote config and set environment variables
     remote_env.read_to_os()
     print(os.environ['TEST'])

     # Read from remote config and write to django-environ
     remote_env.read_to_file(file=buffer)
     environ.Env.read_env(buffer, overwrite=True)

     remote_env.delete('TEST')
     
     # Use znodes tree to find custom or default variable from remote config
     remote_env.get('DATABASE_HOST')
     remote_env.get('service_1/host_4/DATABASE_HOST')
     remote_env.read_to_os('service_1', 'service_1/host_4')
```
