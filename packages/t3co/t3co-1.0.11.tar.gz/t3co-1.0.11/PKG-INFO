# **T3CO** : Transportation Technology Total Cost of Ownership Tool
## Description

This repo houses T3CO (Transportation Technology Total Cost of Ownership), software for modeling total cost of ownership for commercial vehicles with advanced powertrains.

To get started, read the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/NREL/T3CO/blob/main/docs/quick_start.md)

For information on the T3CO models, go to the [Overview](https://github.com/NREL/T3CO/blob/main/docs/T3CO_Overview.md)

## Usage

**T3CO** is a general framework allowing a user to determine the total cost of ownership (TCO) of a FASTSim vehicle (paired with a FASTSim DriveCycle(s) for determining fuel efficiency). The user can also determine performance of gradeability, acceleration, and range. In addition to straight TCO computation there is also the option to optimize a vehicle powertrain such that it meets performance optional targets while also optionally minimizing TCO.

## Installation
T3CO is available on PyPI and as a public access GitHub repository. This gives the user two ways of installing the T3CO Python Package.
### 1. Installing From [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/t3co/)
```bash
pip install t3co
```

### 2. Cloning the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/NREL/T3CO)
T3CO can also be installed directly from a clone of the GitHub repository which makes it easier to access input files and run the tool using a Command Line Interface.

First, [clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/NREL/T3CO) from your desired directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NREL/T3CO.git T3CO
```

From within the [Python environment](./docs/installation.md#setting-up-env), navigate to the parent directory containing the T3CO repository (e.g. `cd GitHub/T3CO/`) and run:
```bash
pip install -e .
```
This installs the local version of the T3CO clone along with all its [dependencies](https://github.com/NREL/T3CO/blob/main/requirements.txt).

### Copying the Demo Input Files
The [`t3co.resources`](https://github.com/NREL/T3CO/tree/main/t3co/resources) folder contains all the necessary input files needed for running T3CO. To get an offline copy of this folder in your preferred directory, run:
```bash
install_t3co_demo_inputs
```

More information on the demo input files can be found in the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/NREL/T3CO/blob/main/docs/installation.md#copy-demo-inputs)


## Running T3CO
T3CO needs three main input files (*Vehicles*, *Scenarios*, and *Config*) to run an analysis. The analysis settings, file paths to main and auxiliary input files, and other parameter overrides are saved as an entry on the *Config* file. The user is provided with 500+ *Vehicle-Scenario* pairs inputs and four *Config* sample analyses to choose from to modify parameters and/or run their first T3CO analysis. The main module for T3CO,`t3co.sweep`, can be run using:

```bash
python -m t3co.sweep --analysis-id=0 --config=<path/to/T3COConfig.csv>
```

Point the `--config` argument to the `T3COConfig.csv` file path (either the t3co/resource/T3COConfig.csv file in a repo clone or the demo_inputs/T3COConfig.csv file after copying the demo input files. This parameter defaults to the T3COConfig.csv file in the t3co.resources module) and `--analysis-id` to the desired `config.analysis_id` (either an existing row or a newly added "Analysis" row in the `T3COConfig.csv` file. Default = `0`).

Additional information on the inputs, the Batch Mode feature, other CLI arguments, and description of T3CO results are mentioned in the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/NREL/T3CO/blob/main/docs/quick_start.md)
