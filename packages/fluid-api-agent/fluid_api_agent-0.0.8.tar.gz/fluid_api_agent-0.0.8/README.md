Welcome to **FluidAPI**, a revolutionary framework that allows you to interact with APIs using **natural language**. No more JSON, headers, or complex formats‚Äîsimply describe your request in plain English, and FluidAPI will do the rest.

Powered by the **Swarms Framework** and created by [Kye Gomez](https://github.com/kyegomez), FluidAPI redefines how developers interact with APIs.

---

## üåü Features

- **Natural Language API Requests**: Just describe your task, and FluidAPI generates and executes the request for you.
- **Powered by AI Agents**: Built on the robust [Swarms Framework](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms), enabling dynamic and intelligent API handling.
- **Effortless Integration**: Replace complex API workflows with simple, human-friendly commands.
- **Retry and Reliability**: Automatic retries and error handling for seamless performance.
- **Dynamic Authentication**: Handles token management and injects them automatically.

## üöÄ Installation

Install the `fluid-api-agent` package via pip:

```bash
pip install fluid-api-agent
```

---

## üîß Getting Started

### Simple Example

```python
from fluid_api_agent.main import (
    fluid_api_request,
)

# Example 1: Basic API Request
basic_request = fluid_api_request(
    "Generate an API request to get a random cat fact from https://catfact.ninja/fact"
)

print(basic_request.model_dump_json(indent=4))
```

### Advanced Example
```python
from fluid_api_agent.main import (
    fluid_api_request,
    batch_fluid_api_request,
)

# Example 1: Basic API Request
# Make a simple API request with default parameters
basic_request = fluid_api_request(
    "Generate an API request to get a random cat fact from https://catfact.ninja/fact"
)
print("\n=== Basic Request ===")
print(basic_request.model_dump_json(indent=4))

# Example 2: Request with Raw Response
# Get the raw response without any processing
raw_request = fluid_api_request(
    "Generate an API request to get a random joke from https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke",
    return_raw=True
)
print("\n=== Raw Request ===") 
print(raw_request.model_dump_json(indent=4))

# Example 3: Verbose Request
# Enable detailed logging during request processing
verbose_request = fluid_api_request(
    "Generate an API request to get weather data for New York from OpenWeatherMap",
    verbose=True
)
print("\n=== Verbose Request ===")
print(verbose_request.model_dump_json(indent=4))

# Example 4: Request with Custom Documentation
# Provide API documentation to improve request generation
docs = """
API Endpoint: https://api.example.com/v1/users
Methods: GET, POST
Authentication: Bearer token required
"""
custom_doc_request = fluid_api_request(
    "Generate a request to get all users",
    documentation=docs,
    verbose=True
)
print("\n=== Request with Documentation ===")
print(custom_doc_request.model_dump_json(indent=4))

# Example 5: Batch Processing
# Process multiple API requests in sequence
print("\n=== Batch Request ===")
batch_results = batch_fluid_api_request(
    tasks=[
        "Generate an API request to get a random dog fact from https://dogapi.dog/api/v2/facts",
        "Generate an API request to get a random quote from https://api.quotable.io/random",
        "Generate an API request to get Bitcoin price from CoinGecko public API"
    ],
    verbose=True
)
for i, result in enumerate(batch_results, 1):
    print(f"\nBatch Result {i}:")
    print(result.model_dump_json(indent=4))

```



FluidAPI will:
1. Interpret your request.
2. Generate and execute the appropriate API call.
3. Return the API's response.

### Example
See the [example.py](example.py) file for more examples.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables
FluidAPI uses environment variables for sensitive data:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key.

Set these variables in your `.env` file:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
WORKSPACE_DIR="agent_workspace"

```

---

## üì¶ Advanced Features

### Retry Logic
FluidAPI includes built-in retry logic to handle transient failures automatically. You can configure retry settings directly in the agent.

### Caching
Frequent requests are optimized with caching to improve performance.

## üõ† Development

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/The-Swarm-Corporation/fluidapi.git
cd fluidapi
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üí° How It Works

FluidAPI leverages the **Swarms Framework** to:
1. Parse natural language instructions.
2. Dynamically construct API requests.
3. Execute requests and handle responses intelligently.
