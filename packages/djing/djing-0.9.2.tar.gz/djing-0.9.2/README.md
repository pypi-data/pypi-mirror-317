```

Add `djing` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in your Django project:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...,
    'djing',

```

Make sure to set the `STATIC_ROOT` & `STATIC_URL` in your `settings.py` file before collecting static files:

```python
STATIC_URL = "/static/"

STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / "static"
```

STORAGES = {

            "location": BASE_DIR / "media",  # Replace with your media directory path
        },
    },
    "staticfiles": {
        "BACKEND": "whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage",
    },
}

MEDIA_URL = "/media/"

MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / "media"
```

Run the following command to collect static files:

```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```

Run the Djing installation command:

```bash
