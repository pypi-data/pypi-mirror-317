    bullet_points:
      - "Scientists and engineers often work with complex simulation workflows."
      - "Core logic is often encapsulated in functions that depend on each other."
      - "Managing complex computational workflows can be challenging."
      - "Keeping track of dependencies between functions requires a lot of bookkeeping."
      - "Once you have a working pipeline, you may want to run it with different parameters."
      - "Running on laptop usually requires vastly different code than in parallel on a cluster."
      - "Reproducibility and maintainability are crucial in scientific computing."
      - "Ideally, we focus on the science and not the plumbing."
      - "What if we could automate the creation, execution, and management of function pipelines?"
    extras:
      - "These workflows involve multiple steps, such as data preprocessing, model execution, and analysis."
      - "For example, [bold blue]calculate_fidelity(...)[/] might depend on the output of [bold blue]create_circuit(...)[/], which also depends on other inputs."
      - "As the number of steps and dependencies increases, it becomes harder to keep track of the flow of data and ensure correct execution."
      - "Manually managing inputs and outputs for each function can be error-prone and time-consuming."
      - "This usually involves writing boilerplate code with loops over the parameters, executing the functions, and collecting the results."
      - "Adapting code for different execution environments often involves significant code duplication and platform-specific logic."
      - "It's essential to be able to rerun experiments with the same results and easily update or extend the workflow."
      - "Scientists should spend more time on the problem and less time on writing execution details and boilerplate code."
      - "Not wasting time on plumbing and gathering results!"
