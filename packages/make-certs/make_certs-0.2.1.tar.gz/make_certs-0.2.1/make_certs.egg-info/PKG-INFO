# make-certs

## Description

make-certs is a Python script to easily create chains of X.509 certificates for
SSL/TLS applications.

## Installation

```bash
pip install .
```

## Usage

```bash
make-certs hier.yaml
```

Look at sample file [`hier.yaml`](./hier.yaml).

To add new certificates it is able to extend hierarchy file and run command
again. But avoid to edit entries of already created certificates: its will not
be actually changed. Existing certificate and key files will be recreated with
new options after deletion, but keep in mind possibly broken chain for issued
certificates.

Cetificates can be revoked with CRL. Also revokation will be undo with revoke
record delition in a hier file.
