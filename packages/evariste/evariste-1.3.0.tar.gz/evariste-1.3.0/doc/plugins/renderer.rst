Renderer plugins
================

Renderer plugins define what should be done at the end of the compilation: :ref:`display something in the standard output <plugin_renderer_text>`, :ref:`build an HTML page <plugin_renderer_html>`, etc.
Some plugins are shipped with Ã‰variste, but you can also :ref:`write your own <write_renderer>`.
