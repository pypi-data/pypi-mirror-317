        The `gpbacay_arcane` is a Python library for my custom neuromimetic artificial neural network mechanisms built on top of TensorFlow and Keras.
        This library provides specialized layers and mechanisms for the A.R.C.A.N.E 
        (Augmented Reconstruction of Consciousness through Artificial Neural Evolution) project, 
        enabling the creation of adaptive, biologically-inspired neural networks. 
        It includes features like dynamic reservoirs, spiking neurons, Hebbian learning, and more, 
        all built on top of TensorFlow and Keras.
