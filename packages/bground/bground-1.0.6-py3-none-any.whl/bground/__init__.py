# Obligatory acknowledgement -- the development was co-funded by TACR.
#  TACR requires that the acknowledgement is printed when we run the program.
#  Nevertheless, Python packages run within other programs, not directly.
# The following code ensures that the acknowledgement is printed when:
#  (1) You run this file: __init__.py
#  (2) You run the package from command line: python -m bground
# Technical notes:
#  To get item (2) above, we define __main__.py (next to __init__.py).
#  The usage of __main__.py is not very common, but still quite standard.
