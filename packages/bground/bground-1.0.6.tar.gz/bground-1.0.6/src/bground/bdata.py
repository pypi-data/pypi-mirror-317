Module: bground.bdata
---------------------
The module defines three simple clasess.
The classes keep data for the backround definition.

1. Class XYpoints = coordinates of the user-defined bakground points.
2. Class XYcurve = two numpy arrays defining the whole calculated bkg curve.
3. Class bkg = complete info about the user-defined background, containing:
    - XYpoints object = the user-defined coordinates of bkg point
    - XYcurve object = the calculated background curve
    - a few other properties (name of file for saving bkg, type of bkg)

Technical notes:

* The first two classes (XYpoints, XYcurve) are used just inside the 3rd one.
* The 3rd class (bkg) is used in module iplot = the interactive bkg definition.
* For a common user, the classes are behind the sceenes, completely invisible.

class XYpoints:
    '''
    XYpoints = object containing two lists X,Y.
    The lists X,Y contain X,Y coordinates of background points.
    This simple object is used in the following bkg object below.
    '''
    
    def __init__(self, X=[], Y=[]):
        '''
        Initialize XYpoints object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : list, optional, the default is []
            X-coordinates of user-defined background points
        Y : list, optional, the default is []
            Y-coordinates of user-defined background points

        Returns
        -------
        New XYobject.

        Add one background point to XYpoints object.
        

        Parameters
        ----------
        Xcoord : float
            X-coordinate of a background point.
        Ycoord : float
            Y-coordinate of a background point.

        Returns
        -------
        None; just the Xcoord,Ycoord are added to XYpoints object.

    XYcurve = object containing two 1D numpy arrays X,Y.

        Y : TYPE, optional

        Parameters
        ----------
        basename : str
            Basename of output file = filename without extension.
            The extension will be added automatically according to context.
        points : bdata.XYpoints object
            Coordinates of user-defined backround points.
        curve  : bdata.XYcurve object
            Backround curve = X,Y of all points of the calculated background.
        btype : string; default is 'linear' 
            Background interpolation type
            = interpolation during backround calculation.
            Implemented interpolation types: 'linear', 'quadratic', 'cubic'.
            
        Returns
        -------
        None; the result is the initialized object: bdata.bkg.
        
        Technical notes
        ---------------
        * In function definition, we use XYpoints([],[]) and XYcurve([],[]).
        * The empty arrays should eliminate possible non-zero values
          from possible previous run in Spyder.
        * Nevertheless, in current version this is not sufficient
          and the background in the main program must be initialized
          with empty objects XYpoints and XYcurve as well.
        * At the moment, I regard this as a Python mystery.
