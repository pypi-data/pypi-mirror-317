Module: bground.bfunc
---------------------
Functions for the background calculation.

* The functions are usually called indirectly, from bground.iplot module.
* The bground.iplot module defines an interactive plot, which is used as a GUI.

Technical notes:

* All functions in this module manipulate with bground.bdata.bkg object.
    - The bkg object contains all info needed for background subtraction.
* The last function works also with data = 2D-numpy array object.
    - The 2D-numpy array = a 2-row array: [X,Y] => Y should be bkgr-corrected.
    - The last function calculates a 3-row array: [X,Y,background-corrected-Y].

def sort_bkg_points(bkg):
    '''
    Sort background points according to their X-coordinate.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    bkg : bground.bdata.bkg object
        A bkg object containing (among other things)
        an unsorted list of background points.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        The result is the updated bkg object.
        The updated object contains bkg.points sorted according to
        their X-coordinate.

    # Sorting is based on the trick found on www

def calculate_background(data,bkg):
    '''
    Calculate background
    = calculate interpolated background curve;
    the calculated background curve is saved within bkg object.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    data : 
        
    bkg : bground.bdata.bkg object
        Object containing the following items:
            
        * basename = string, basename of output file(s)
        * points = 3-column list: [PointType, X-coord, Y-coord]
        * btype = a type of interpolation for the calculation of the bkground
    
    Returns
    -------
    None
        The result is the updated bkg object.
        
        * bkg.X = calculated X-coordinates of the whole background
        * bkg.Y = calculated Y-coordinates of the WHOLE background

    Subtract background

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : 2D numpy array
        The array contains two colums [X,Intensity].
    bkg : bdata.bkg object
