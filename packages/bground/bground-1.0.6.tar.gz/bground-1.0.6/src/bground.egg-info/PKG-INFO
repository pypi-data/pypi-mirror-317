BGROUND :: semi-automated background subtraction
------------------------------------------------

* BGROUND performs semi-automated background subtraction for XY-data.
	- XY-data = usually a file with two (or more) columns - (X-data,Y-data).
	- The user can define which columns represent the XY-data to process.
* How does it work?
	- BGROUND reads XY-data and shows them in an interactive plot.
	- The user defines background points (with a mouse + keyboard).
	- BGROUND does the rest (background calculation and subtraction).

Installation
------------
* Requirement: Python with sci-modules: numpy, matplotlib, scipy, pandas
* `pip install bground` = standard installation, no other packages needed

Quick start
-----------
* Look at the
  [worked example](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/l3rripp1pjby50law3jbr/01_bground.nb.pdf?rlkey=x8p2dx4eaea3qepm94y485kk7&st=k27iewfw&dl=0)
  to see how BGROUND works.
