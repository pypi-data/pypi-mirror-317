"""
The `rthread` module provides foundational classes for creating multi-threaded automation objects.

Classes:
    AutomationObject: A generic base class for automation objects.
    IWorkerThread: A base class for threads that can be spawned by automation objects.

These classes are highly flexible and designed to handle various tasks asynchronously, 
making them suitable for a wide range of applications.

Justification for subclassing from `Thread`: sharing the common memory space.

.. todo:: Decouple the functionality from the thread so that it 
can be run by any means, e.g., by process or asyncio.
