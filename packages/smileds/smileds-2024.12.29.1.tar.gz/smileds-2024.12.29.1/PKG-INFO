# SMI LEDs

This project allows you to drive 8 or 16 WS2812 LED strips with one single Raspberry Pi!

The basis for this project is Jeremy P Bentham's [rpi_smi_leds](https://github.com/jbentham/rpi/tree/master)
project that uses the RPi's SMI memory interface to accurately drive 8 or 16 LED strips -- flicker free and without
a lot of CPU overhead -- simply amazing. For all the gory details on how this works,
read Jeremy's excellent blog post about his code:

    https://iosoft.blog/category/neopixel/

However, Jeremy's code was just that -- some code, but with zero documentaion on how to
build it (several fixes were needed) or how to install it on a RPi. This project 
addresses those shortcomings and packages that code into a deployable project.

You can choose to link to a static C library build with CMake and include it in your
C/C++ project, or you can choose the python module, which can be installed from pip.

IMPORTANT: This code does not run on a Raspberry Pi 5!

## Design philosophy

This module is for advanced users of LED strips and thus it may be missing some of the 
features you'd expect in other modules (e.g. setting indiviual LED values). For the
moment, this module assumes that you are an advanced user of LEDs and thus likely
already have some tools around creating LED sequences in your toolkit. 

The only way to update the leds is via the led_set() function which takes a buffer
of bytes exactly NUM_STRIPS * NUM_LEDS * 3 in size with LED data and sends it to the 
driver. The led_send() function actually shifts the LEDs out to the LED strips.

There is some code in the driver for setting indiviual pixels, but it wasn't working,
so I've not exposed that function. But if people want that, someone should be able to
make it work.

## RGB data structure

For this setup, it is assumed that you have 8 or 16 equally sized LED strips.

Each time you call led_set, MUST send the same number of bytes:

* 8 * num_leds * num_strips * 3 bytes for an 8 strip setup
* 16 * num_leds * num_strips * 3 bytes for a 16 strip setup

If you have LED strips with differing lengths, set num_leds to the length of your
longest LED strip. Then, for all strips that are shorter than the maximum length
pad the RGB with zeros, so that you're always sending the same number of bytes
for each of your strips. The extra zeros will be ignored by the shorter strips.

If you have fewer than 8 or 16 LED strips: Pad the RGB data sent to the strips
out to 8 (or 16) strips. If you have 4 strips, send 4 strips of data and then
4 strips of zeros for a 8 strip setup.


# Installation

## OS Choice

Currently this code only works on a 32 bit Raspberry Pi OS images. 64 bit images are
currently not supported, but I'll see about getting those working as well.

## Raspberry Pi Setup

In order for the smi_leds to work, the i2s system that is used to provide audio
on the RPi must be disabled. The easiest way to do this is to edit 
/boot/firmware/config.txt (previously used to be /boot/config.txt) and
to change the line:

```
#dtparam=i2s=on
```

to

```
dtparam=i2s=off

```

Don't forget to uncomment the line. Once you've made this change, reboot your
RPi.

## Prerequisites

To install this library, you'll need to have the following packages installed:

* python-dev-is-python3: Python dev headers, formerly python3-dev
* cmake

On a recent RPi install, this line should work:

```
sudo apt install -y build-essential python-dev-is-python3 cmake
```

## Install the C/C++ static library

## Prerequisites

To install this library, you'll need to have the following packages installed:

* cmake
* build-essential

```
apt install -y build-essential cmake
```

## Installation

To install smi_leds for 8 LED strands:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

To install for 16 channels, pass an option to cmake:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DENABLE_16_CHANNELS:BOOL=ON
make
sudo make install
```

### Building your own code

To build your own code, run:

```
gcc -I /usr/local/include -L /usr/local/lib my_test.c -lsmi_leds
```

## Install Python 3 module

## Prerequisites

To install this library, you'll need to have the following packages installed:

* python-dev-is-python3: Python dev headers, formerly python3-dev
* cmake
* build-essential

```
sudo apt install -y build-essential python-dev-is-python3 cmake
```

## Installation

To install via pip for 8 LED strands:

```
pip install smileds
```

To install via pip for 16 LED strands:

```
export LED_NCHANS=16
pip install smileds
```

# Hardware Setup

The image below shows the GPIO pins that will drive the LED strips:

![alt text](https://github.com/mayhem/smi_leds/blob/main/docs/rpi_smi_pinout.png?raw=true)

Remember that each one of these outputs will likely need to be level-shifted to 5V
(unless your LED strips are 3.3V tolerant) and have a 300 Ohm resisor in-line if you'd like
to follow best practices.

Here is the same information in a more convenient table:

![alt text](https://github.com/mayhem/smi_leds/blob/main/docs/rpi_smi_pins-2.png?raw=true)

SD0 through SD17 are the GPIOs that will drive your LED strips.

# Software Setup

## C

The full example in examples/example.c. This fragment sets all the LEDs to
white at 25% brightness:

```
    // Allocate a buffer, set it to all 0xFF (white)
    uint8_t buffer[NUM_LEDS * NUM_STRIPS * 3];
    memset(buffer, 0xFF, NUM_LEDS * NUM_STRIPS * 3);

    // initialize the smi_leds module, starting with a 25% brightness
    leds_init(NUM_LEDS, 25);
    
    // Transfer our local buffer to the SMI buffer
    leds_set(buffer);

    // Shift the SMI buffer out to the LEDs
    leds_send();
```

## Python 3

The python version is quite similar:

```
import smileds
from time import sleep

num_leds = 25
num_strips = 1

# initialize the smi_leds module, starting with a 25% brightness
smileds.leds_init(num_leds, 25)

# Build the LED data array
leds = bytearray()
for strip in range(num_strips):
    for led in range(num_leds):
        leds += bytearray((255, 0, 255))

# Set the buffer into to the smileds module
smileds.leds_set(leds)

# Shift them out to the strips
smileds.leds_send()

# Wait while the data is shifted to the SMI bus
sleep(1)
```

This code snipped will turn 25 leds purple on 1 strip at brightness 25%.

# Troubleshooting

A common problem might be getting a segmentation fault when calling leds_set(), which is caused by sending in the
wrong buffer size for the current number of strip configuration. If you setup smi_leds with 8 strips, you need to
pass in a buffer to the C functions that is at least 3 * 8 * NUM_LEDs large.

# Demo video

Here is a super short demonstration video for this module in action:

# Future work

This module could use various improvements over time if people are interesting in developing it further:

* Consider adding gamma correction
* Debug the set_pixel() function to allow changing single pixels

Also, if someone else would like to take over the development of this module, I would be
happy to pass it on.
