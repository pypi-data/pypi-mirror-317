# AgenticFleet

AgenticFleet is an advanced repository designed to create robust multi-agent systems. It builds upon the foundational concepts of Magentic-One, a generalist multi-agent system, while introducing an independent and enhanced framework. AgenticFleet focuses on empowering multi-agent collaboration using key technologies like AutoGen AgentChat, PydanticAI, and a "prompty friendly" design philosophy.

## Key Features

- **AutoGen AgentChat Integration**: Facilitates seamless communication and collaboration among agents with high-level APIs and preset interaction templates, streamlining multi-agent workflows.

- **Independent Framework Evolution**: While inspired by Magentic-One, AgenticFleet offers a more customizable and adaptable architecture, enabling advanced agent autonomy and communication protocols.

- **PydanticAI for Validation**: Combines Pydantic's data modeling and schema validation capabilities with AI systems, ensuring data integrity and simplifying the development of production-grade applications.

- **Prompty Friendly Design**: Provides tools optimized for creating and fine-tuning language model prompts, making it easier to integrate, debug, and customize LLM-based workflows.

## Target Users

AgenticFleet is ideal for developers aiming to build scalable, reliable, and user-friendly multi-agent systems in areas like AI collaboration, automation, and conversational platforms. It reduces complexity while providing the flexibility to tackle both general-purpose tasks and specific, domain-focused challenges.
