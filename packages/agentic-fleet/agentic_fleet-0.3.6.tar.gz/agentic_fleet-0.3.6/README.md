# Agentic Fleet

A powerful framework for building and managing fleets of AI agents.

## Vision

Agentic Fleet aims to provide a flexible and robust platform for developing and deploying sophisticated multi-agent systems. We strive to empower developers to create AI solutions that can tackle complex tasks through coordinated effort and intelligent collaboration.

## Features

- ü§ñ **Multiple Agent Types**: Agentic Fleet supports a variety of specialized agents, each designed with specific capabilities:
  - **Planner**: Decomposes complex tasks into manageable steps and creates execution plans.
  - **Executor**: Executes tasks, monitors progress, and handles task completion.
  - **Researcher**: Gathers and analyzes information from various sources to support decision-making.
  - **Critic**: Evaluates the quality of work, provides feedback, and ensures adherence to standards.
  - **Video Surfer**: Analyzes video content, extracts key information, and summarizes findings.
  - **File Surfer**: Navigates and manipulates file systems, enabling agents to interact with local data.
  - **Web Surfer**: Interacts with web content, retrieves information, and automates web-based tasks.

- üîÑ **Advanced Prompt Management**: Efficiently manage and optimize agent behavior with:
  - Version control for prompts, allowing for iterative refinement and rollback.
  - Hot reloading capabilities, enabling real-time updates to prompt configurations.
  - A/B testing support for comparing the effectiveness of different prompts.
  - Metrics collection and analysis to understand prompt performance and impact.

- üõ†Ô∏è **Extensible Architecture**: Build upon a solid foundation with:
  - Modular design that promotes flexibility and maintainability.
  - Easy agent customization, allowing developers to tailor agents to specific needs.
  - Flexible tool integration, enabling agents to leverage a wide range of functionalities.
  - Robust error handling to ensure reliable operation and graceful recovery.

- üìä **Monitoring & Analytics**: Gain insights into your agent fleet's performance with:
  - Detailed metrics tracking to monitor key performance indicators.
  - Performance analysis tools to identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization.
  - Usage statistics to understand agent activity and resource consumption.
  - Error reporting to quickly identify and address issues.

## Installation

### Using pip

```bash
pip install agentic-fleet
```

### Using PDM (recommended)

```bash
pdm add agentic-fleet
```

### Development Installation

To set up a development environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agentic-fleet.git
cd agentic-fleet
pdm install
```

## Quick Start

```python
from fleets import PlannerAgent, ExecutorAgent, ResearcherAgent

# Initialize agents
planner = PlannerAgent()
executor = ExecutorAgent()
researcher = ResearcherAgent()

# Create a task
task = "Build a web application with user authentication"

# Plan the task
plan = await planner.create_plan(task)

# Research requirements
research = await researcher.gather_information(task)

# Execute the plan
result = await executor.execute_plan(plan)
```

## Configuration

The framework can be configured using environment variables or a `.env` file:

```env
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-12-01
```
