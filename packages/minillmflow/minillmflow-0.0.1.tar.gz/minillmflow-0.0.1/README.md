A 100-line minimalist LLM framework for agents, task decomposition, RAG, etc.

- Install via  ```pip install minillmflow```, or just copy the [source](minillmflow/__init__.py) (only 100 lines)

- **Pro tip:** Build LLM apps with LLMs assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) via [this prompt](minillmflow/docs/prompt)

## Why Mini LLM Flow?

The future of LLM app development will be **heavily LLM-assisted**: users specify requirements, and LLMs build, test, and maintain on their own. Current LLM assistants:

1. **üòÄ Shine at Low-level Implementation**: 
With proper docs, LLMs can handle APIs, tools, chunking, prompt wrapping, etc. 
These are hard to maintain and optimize for a general-purpose framework.

2. **‚òπÔ∏è Struggle with High-level Paradigms**:
Paradigms like MapReduce, task decomposition, and agents are powerful for development.
However, designing these elegantly remains challenging for LLMs.

To enable LLMs to develop LLM app, a framework should
(1) remove specialized low-level implementations, and
(2) keep high-level paradigms to program against.
Hence, I built this framework that lets LLMs focus on what matters. It turns out 100 lines is all you need.
