[map_color_adj]
# This optional section contains color adjustment values for custom basemaps.  Each setting key
# should be the name of a basemap tile, and each value should be a set of three floating-point
# numbers.  These numbers are the adjustments to be made to saturation, contrast, and
# brightness, respectively.  Negative values decrease the saturation, etc., and positive values
# increase the values.


[symbols]
# This section contains file names (with paths) for additional symbols that can be loaded
# for use on the map.  The key should be a symbol name, and the value should be the name
# of a file containing an X11 bitmap (.xbm) for the symbol.  These can be used as map markers
# or as the marker for selected locations.
