## 🎦 Introduction
TL;DR: VE-Bench is an evaluation suite for text-driven video editing, consisting of a quality assessment model to provide a human-aligned metric for edited videos, and a database containing rich video-prompt pairs and the corresponding human scores.

Overview of the VE-Bench Suite
</div>

VE-Bench DB contains a rich collection of source videos, including real-world videos, AIGC videos, and CG videos, covering various aspects such as people, objects, animals, and landscapes. It also includes a variety of editing instructions across different categories, including semantic editing like addition, removal, replacement, etc., as well as structural changes in size, shape, etc., and stylizations such as color, texture, etc. Additionally, it features editing results based on different video editing models. We conducted a subjective experiment involving 24 participants from diverse backgrounds, resulting in 28,080 score samples. We further trained VE-Bench QA model based on this data. The left image below shows the box plot of average scores obtained by each model during the subjective experiment, while the right image illustrates the scores for each model across different types of prompts.

## Easy Use
VE-Bench can be installed with a single ``pip`` command. Since the model employs normalization during training, its output does not represent absolute scores. We **recommend performing comparisons between video pairs**, as demonstrated below:
```
pip install vebench
```
When comparing videos:
```
from vebench import VEBenchModel

evaluator = VEBenchModel()

score1 = evaluator.evaluate('A black-haired boy is turning his head', 'assets/src.mp4', 'assets/dst.mp4')
score2 = evaluator.evaluate('A black-haired boy is turning his head', 'assets/src.mp4', 'assets/dst2.mp4')
print(score1, score2) # Score1: 1.3563, Score2: 0.66194
```


## Local Inference

### 💼 Preparation
. You can also download all checkpoints from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kD82Ex90VP9A_AqjYV1J5DYvBQW-hkXa?usp=sharing) and put them into ``ckpts``.

### ✨ Usage
To evaluate one single video:
```
python -m infer.py --single_test --src_path ${path_to_source_video} --dst_path ${path_to_dst_video} --prompt ${editing_prompt}

# Run on example videos
# python -m infer.py --single_test --src_path "./data/src/00433tokenflow_baby_gaze.mp4" --dst_path "./data/edited/00433tokenflow_baby_gaze.mp4" --prompt "A black-haired boy is turning his head" 
```


To evaluate a set of videos:
```
python -m infer.py --data_path ${path_to_data_folder} --label_path ${path_to_prompt_txt_file}
```
