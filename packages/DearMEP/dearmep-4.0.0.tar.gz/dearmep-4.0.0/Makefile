# Format the code. Sort imports first, as recommended by

# satisfy the recommendation of running the linter with ISC disabled before
# running the formatter, as noted in the ISC001 and ISC002 rules.

# Add "noqa" markers to everything that the linter complains about. This can be
# handy to use once you've fixed all legitimate warnings, to silence the rest
# (hopefully because they're false positives).

# Check type annotations and run tests. This is a bit slower and recommended not
