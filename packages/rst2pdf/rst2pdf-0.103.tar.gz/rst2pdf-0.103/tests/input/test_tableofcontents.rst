This test ensures that:

1. The table of contents has a depth of 3 levels
2. The level for open outline entries that are usually viewed in a PDF viewer
   as a collapsible tree matches the number of levels in the table of contents.

   Any further nested headings will be available in the outline, but collapsed.
3. Every heading has a section number
