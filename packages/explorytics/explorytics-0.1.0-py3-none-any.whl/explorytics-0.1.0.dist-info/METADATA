# Explorytics

Explorytics is a Python library designed to simplify the process of exploratory data analysis (EDA). With an intuitive interface and powerful visualization tools, it provides quick insights into datasets, helping you understand distributions, correlations, and outliers with ease.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Perform statistical and visual analysis in a few lines of code.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Generate dynamic plots for distributions, correlations, and relationships.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identify and explore outliers across various features.
- **User-Friendly API**: Designed for simplicity and ease of use, even for beginners.

## Installation

Install Explorytics using pip:

```bash
pip install explorytics
```

## Getting Started

Here's a quick example of how to use Explorytics with the Wine dataset from scikit-learn:

```python
# Import required libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_wine
from explorytics import DataAnalyzer

# Load the wine dataset
wine = load_wine()
df = pd.DataFrame(wine.data, columns=wine.feature_names)
df['wine_class'] = wine.target

# Initialize the analyzer
analyzer = DataAnalyzer(df)

# Perform analysis
results = analyzer.analyze()

# Generate a distribution plot
analyzer.visualizer.plot_distribution('alcohol', kde=True).show()

# Generate a correlation heatmap
analyzer.visualizer.plot_correlation_matrix().show()
```
