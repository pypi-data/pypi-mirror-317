## The Lean Solution for Managing NGS and Omics Data

ReadStore is a platform for storing, managing, and integrating omics data. It speeds up analysis and offers a simple way of managing and sharing NGS omics datasets, metadata and processed data (**Pro**cessed **Data**).
Built-in project and metadata management structures your workflows and a collaborative user interface enhances teamwork — so you can focus on generating insights.

The integrated Webservice (API) enables your to directly retrieve data from ReadStore via the terminal [Command-Line-Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/EvobyteDigitalBiology/readstore-cli) or [Python](https://github.com/EvobyteDigitalBiology/pyreadstore) / [R](https://github.com/EvobyteDigitalBiology/r-readstore) SDKs.

The ReadStore Basic version provides a local webserver with a simple user management. If you need an organization-wide deployment, advanced user and group management or cloud integration please check the ReadStore Advanced versions and reach out to info@evo-byte.com.

## Description

PyReadStore is a Python client (SDK) that lets you easily connect to your ReadStore server and interact with the ReadStore API.
By importing the pyreadstore package in Python, you can quickly retrieve data from a ReadStore server.

This tool provides streamlined and standardized access to NGS datasets and metadata, helping you run analyses more efficiently and with fewer errors.
You can easily scale your pipelines, and if you need to migrate or move NGS data, updating the ReadStore database ensures all your workflows stay up-to-date.


## Security and Permissions<a id="backup"></a>

**PLEASE READ AND FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY!**

### User Accounts and Token<a id="token"></a>

Using PyReadStore requires an active user account and a token (and a running ReadStore server). 

You should **never enter your user account password** when working with PyReadStore.

To retrieve your token:

1. Login to the ReadStore app via your browser
2. Navigate to `Settings` page and click on `Token`
3. You can regenerate your token anytime (`Reset`). This will invalidate the previous token

For uploading FASTQ files your user account needs to have `Staging Permission`.
You can check this in the `Settings` page of your account.
If you not have `Staging Permission`, ask your ReadStore server admin to grant you permission.

### Setting Your Credentials

You need to provide the PyReadStore client with valid ReadStore credentials.

There are different options

1. Load credentials from the ReadStore `config` file. 
The file is generated by the [ReadStore CLI](https://github.com/EvobyteDigitalBiology/readstore-cli),
by default in your home directory (`~/.readstore/`). Make sure to keep read permissions to the file restrictive

2. Directly enter your username and token when instantiating a PyReadStore client within your Python code

3. Set username and token via environment variables (`READSTORE_USERNAME`, `READSTORE_TOKEN`). This is useful in container or cloud environments.


## Installation

`pip3 install pyreadstore`

You can perform the install in a conda or venv virtual environment to simplify package management.

A local install is also possible

`pip3 install --user pyreadstore`
 

```python 
import pyreadstore
```

## ReadStore API<a id="api"></a>

The **ReadStore Basic** server provides a RESTful API for accessing resources via HTTP requests.  
This API extends the functionalities of the ReadStore CLI as well as the Python and R SDKs.

### API Endpoint
By default, the API is accessible at:  
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/api_x_v1/`

### Authentication
Users must authenticate using their username and token via the Basic Authentication scheme.

### Example Usage
Below is an example demonstrating how to use the ReadStore CLI to retrieve an overview of Projects by sending an HTTP `GET` request to the `project/` endpoint.  
In this example, the username is `testuser`, and the token is `0dM9qSU0Q5PLVgDrZRftzw`. You can find your token in the ReadStore settings.

```bash
curl -X GET -u testuser:0dM9qSU0Q5PLVgDrZRftzw http://localhost:8000/api_x_v1/project/
```

#### Example Reponse

A successful HTTP response returns a JSON-formatted string describing the project(s) in the ReadStore database. Example response:

```
[{
  "id": 4,
  "name": "TestProject99",
  "metadata": {
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2"
  },
  "attachments": []
}]
```

### Documentation

Comprehensive [API documentation](https://evobytedigitalbiology.github.io/readstore/rest_api/) is available in the ReadStore Basic Docs.


## Usage

Detailed tutorials, videos and explanations are found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk-WMGySW9ySUfZU25NyA5YgzmHQ7yquv) or on the [**EVO**BYTE blog](https://evo-byte.com/blog).

### Quickstart<a id="quickstart"></a>

Let's access some dataset and project data from the ReadStore database!

Make sure a ReadStore server is running and reachable (by default under `127.0.0.1:8000`).
You can enter (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/api_v1/`) in your browser and should get a response from the API.

We assume you ran `readstore configure` before to create a config file for your user.
If not, consult the [ReadStore CLI](https://github.com/EvobyteDigitalBiology/readstore-cli) README on how to set this up.

We will create a client instance and perform some operations to retrieve data from the ReadStore database.
More information on all available methods can be found below.


```python 
import pyreadstore

rs_client = pyreadstore.Client() # Create an instance of the ReadStore client

# Manage Datasets

datasets = rs_client.list()      # List all datasets and return pandas dataframe

datasets_project_1 = rs_client.list(project_id = 1) # List all datasets for project 1

datasets_id_25 = rs_client.get(dataset_id = 25)     # Get detailed data for dataset 25

# Manage Projects

projects = rs_client.list_projects()                # List all projects

projects = rs_client.get_project(project_name = 'MyProject') # Get details for MyProject

fastq_data_id_25 = rs_client.get_fastq(dataset_id = 25)     # Get fastq file data for dataset 25

rs_client.download_attachment(dataset_id = 25,              # Download files attached to dataset 25
                              attachment_name = 'gene_table.tsv') 

# Manage Processed Data

rs_client.upload_pro_data(name = 'sample_1_count_matrix',      # Set name of count matrix
                            pro_data_file = 'path/to/sample_1_counts.h5',   # Set file path
                            data_type = 'count_matrix',                     # Set type to 'count_matrix'
                            dataset_id = 25)                                # Set dataset id for upload

pro_data_project_1 = rs_client.list_pro_data(project_id = 1) # Get all ProData entries for Project 1

pro_data = rs_client.get_pro_data(name = 'sample_1_count_matrix',   # Set name to sample_1_count_matrix
                                dataset_id = 25)                    # dataset_id

pro_data_id = rs_client.delete_pro_data(name = 'sample_1_count_matrix',
                                        dataset_id = 25)

# Ingest FASTQ files

rs_client.upload_fastq(fastq = ['path/to_fastq_r1.fq', 'path/to_fastq_r2.fq'], # Upload a FASTQ files
                        fastq_name = ['sample_rep_1_r1', 'sample_rep_1_r2'],    # Set FASTQ names
                        read_type = ['R1', 'R2'])                               # Set individual FASTQ read types
```


### Configure the Python Client<a id="client_config"></a>

The Client is the central object and provides authentication against the ReadStore API.
By default, the client will try to read the `~/.readstore/config` credentials file.
You can change the directory if your config file is located in another folder.

If you set the `username` and `token` arguments, the client will use these credentials instead.

If your ReadStore server is not running under localhost (`127.0.0.1`) port `8000`, you can adapt the default settings.

```python 
pyreadstore.Client(config_dir: str = '~/.readstore',  # Directory containing ReadStore credentials
                  username: str | None = None,        # Username
                  token : str | None = None,          # Token
                  host: str = 'http://localhost',     # Hostname / IP of ReadStore server
                  return_type: str = 'pandas',        # Default return types, can be pandas or json
                  port: int = 8000,                   # Server Port Number
                  fastq_extensions: List[str] = ['.fastq','.fastq.gz','.fq','.fq.gz']) 
                  # Accepted FASTQ file extensions for upload validation 
```

Is is possible to set userame, token, server endpoint and fastq extensions using the listed environment variables. 
The enironment variables precede over other client configurations.

- `READSTORE_USERNAME` (username)
- `READSTORE_TOKEN` (token)
- `READSTORE_ENDPOINT_URL` (`http://host:post`, e.g. `http://localhost:8000`)
- `READSTORE_FASTQ_EXTENSIONS` (fastq_extensions, `'.fastq',.fastq.gz,.fq,.fq.gz'`)

**Possible errors**

    - Connection Error:     If no ReadStore server was found at the provided endpoint
    - Authentication Error: If provided username or token are not found
    - No Permission to Upload/Delete FASTQ/ProData: User has no [Staging Permissions]

### Access Datasets<a id="access_datasets"></a>

```python 
# List ReadStore Datasets

rs_client.list(project_id: int | None = None,   # Filter datasets for project with id `project_id`
              project_name: str | None = None,  # Filter datasets for project with name `project_name`
               return_type: str | None = None   # Return pd.DataFrame or JSON type
               ) -> pd.DataFrame | List[dict]

# Get ReadStore Dataset Details
# Provide dataset_id OR dataset_name

rs_client.get(dataset_id: int| None = None,     # Get dataset with id `dataset_id`
              dataset_name: str | None = None,  # Filter datasets with name `dataset_name`
              return_type: str | None = None    # Return pd.Series or json(dict)
              ) -> pd.Series | dict

# Get FASTQ file data for a dataset
# Provide dataset_id OR dataset_name

rs_client.get_fastq(dataset_id: int| None = None,    # Get fastq data for dataset with id `dataset_id`
                  dataset_name: str | None = None,   # Get fastq data for dataset `dataset_name`
                  return_type: str | None = None     # Return pd.Series or json(dict)
                  ) -> pd.DataFrame | List[dict]
```

### Edit Datasets

**NOTE** Editing methods as create or delete require `Staging Permission` authorization.

When creating datasets, the `name` argument and `metadata` dictionary are checked for consistency: Each must not be empty, contain only alphanumeric characters (plus _-.@). Metadata keys must not contain reserved keywords (listed below).

```python 
# Create an empty Dataset, without FASTQ files attached

# Name must be unique in Database
# Optionally define Project IDs and/or Project names to attach Dataset to.  

rs_client.create(name: str,                       # Set name
                 description: str = '',           # Set description. Defaults to ''.
                 project_ids: List[int] = [],     # Set project_ids. Defaults to [].
                 project_names: List[str] = [],   # Set project_names. Defaults to [].
                 metadata: dict = {})              # Set metadata. Defaults to {}.
                 

# Delete Dataset (and attached FASTQ files)
# Either dataset_id or dataset_name argument must be provided

rs_client.delete(dataset_id: int | None = None,   # Delete by ID. Defaults to None.
                 dataset_name: str | None = None)  # Delete by Name. Defaults to None.
```


### Access Projects<a id="access_projects"></a>

```python 
# List ReadStore Projects

rs_client.list_projects(return_type: str | None = None   # Return pd.DataFrame or JSON type
                        ) -> pd.DataFrame | List[dict]

# Get ReadStore Project Details
# Provide project_id OR project_name

rs_client.get_project(project_id: int| None = None,     # Get dataset with id `project_id`
                      project_name: str | None = None,  # Filter datasets with name `project_name`
                      return_type: str | None = None    # Return pd.Series or json(dict)
                      ) -> pd.Series | dict
```

### Edit Projects

**NOTE** Editing methods as create or delete require `Staging Permission` authorization. 

When creating datasets, the `name` argument and `metadata` dictionary are checked for consistency: Each must not be empty, contain only alphanumeric characters (plus _-.@). Metadata keys must not contain reserved keywords (listed below).

```python 
# Create ReadStore Project

# name must be unique in Database
# dataset_metadata_keys can be attached and will be set as default metadata keys for attached datasets

rs_client.create_project(name: str,                       # Set Project name
                         description: str = '',           # Set Project description. Defaults to ''.
                         metadata: dict = {},             # Set Project metadata. Defaults to {}.
                         dataset_metadata_keys: List[str] = [])  # Set dataset metadata keys. Defaults to [].

# Delete ReadStore Project

# Either project_id or project_name argument must be provided

rs_client.delete_project(project_id: int | None = None,    # Delete by ID. Defaults to None.
                         project_name: str | None = None)  # Delete by Name. Defaults to None.
