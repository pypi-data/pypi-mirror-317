SEP005 24SEA io influxdb
------------------------

Basic package to import data collected from the 24SEA DF2.0 influx-db compliant with
SDyPy format for timeseries as proposed in SEP005.

Installation
-------------
Important prerequisite
======================

As written in the documentation of the python influx-db client, it is recommended to use ``ciso8601`` with client for
parsing dates. ``ciso8601`` is much faster than built-in Python datetime. Since it's written as a C module the best way is build it from sources:

Easiest way to install is through **conda** :
``conda install -c conda-forge/label/cf202003 ciso8601``



Client configuration
====================
The influxdb client is best configured using the a configuration file. For 24SEA application this can be done using the
project's ``{project_name}_postprocessing.ini`` configuration file.

Using the package
