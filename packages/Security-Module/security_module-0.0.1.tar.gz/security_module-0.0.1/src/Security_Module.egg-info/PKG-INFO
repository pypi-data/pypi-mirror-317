# Telegram Bot Security Module


## Description

The security module is designed to ensure the protection of your Telegram bot. It includes functions for user authentication, access verification, and protection against potential threats.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, make sure that you have Python and pip installed. Then run the following command:

    bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

Import the security module in your main bot file (for example, bot.py ):
   
    python
    from security import SecurityModule


### User authentication

The module provides functions for user authentication. You can use the authenticate_user method to check if the user has access to certain functions of the bot.

Example:

    python
    security = SecurityModule()


### Checking access rights

You can also use the check_permissions method to verify the user's access rights to certain commands or functions of the bot.

Example:

    python
    if security.checkpermissions(userid, 'admin'):


## Protection from threats

The module includes protection mechanisms against attacks such as spam and DoS. It can track the number of requests from users and block those who exceed the allowed limit.

### Example of configuring anti-spam

    python
    security.setspamlimit(user_id, limit=5)  # Maximum of 5 requests per minute
