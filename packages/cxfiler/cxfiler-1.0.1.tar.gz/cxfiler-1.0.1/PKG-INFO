#  F.I.L.E.R.

###  (File Investigation with Less Effort and Remembering)

----------------------------------------


 FILER is an intuitive file explorer with modern input and ease-of-use.

##  Installation


 As FILER is a Python application, it is installed via ```pip```.

```
pip3 install cxfiler

```



 To fully get the most use out of FILER, you should also add the following to your shell profile ( ```.bashrc```, ```.bash_profile```, ```.zshrc```, etc.):

```
filer() {
	cxfiler
	cd $(cat $HOME/.cxfilerexit)
}

```



 This will create a shell function which will run FILER and then change directory to the directory FILER was pointed to when you quit.
