"""This module holds classes related to FIFO queues.

This module contains `Queue`, an implementation of a FIFO queue, and `QueueUnderflowError`, an error raised by `Queue`.

Examples:
    Initializing, adding, and removing elements from a `Queue`:

        q = Queue()
        q.enqueue(1)
        q.enqueue(2)
        q.dequeue()

    The following code will raise a `QueueUnderflowError` because the second dequeue is done on an empty `Queue`:

        q.dequeue()
        q.dequeue()
