"""This module holds classes related to LIFO stacks.

This module contains `Stack`, an implementation of a LIFO stack, and `StackUnderflowError`, an error raised by `Stack`.

Examples:
    Initializing, adding, and removing elements from a `Stack`:

        s = Stack()
        s.push(1)
        s.push(2)
        s.pop()

    The following code will raise a `StackUnderflowError` because the second pop is done on an empty `Stack`:

        s.pop()
        s.pop()
