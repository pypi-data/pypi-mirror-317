"""Module that holds classes related to hashing.

This module contains the `HashTable` class. `HashTable` represents a hash table.

Examples:
    Creating a `HashTable`, adding key-value pairs, and retrieving values:

        t = HashTable()
        t.insert('a', 1)
        t.insert('b', 2)
        t.insert('c', 3)
        x = t.get_value('a')

    Removing elements from a `HashTable`:

        t.delete('a')

    Examples:
        To initialize a `HashTable`:
