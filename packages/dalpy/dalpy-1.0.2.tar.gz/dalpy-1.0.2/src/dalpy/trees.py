"""Module that holds classes and functions related to trees.

This module contains the `BinaryTreeNode` and `NaryTreeNode` classes. `BinaryTreeNode` can be used to recursively define
a binary tree. `NaryTreeNode` can be used to recursively define a doubly linked list. Problems or algorithms that
operate on trees should take an object of either of these classes. This module also contains the `depth` function which
computes the depth of an `NaryTreeNode` in a tree.

Examples:
    A binary tree can be created as follows:

        bt = BinaryTreeNode(1)
        bt.left = BinaryTreeNode(2)
        bt.right = BinaryTreeNode(3)

    An n-ary tree can be created as follows, where one can also get the depth of one of the children:

        nt = NaryTreeNode(1)
        c1 = NaryTreeNode(2)
        c2 = NaryTreeNode(3)
        c3 = NaryTreeNode(4)
        c1.parent = nt
        c2.parent = nt
        c3.parent = nt
        nt.leftmost_child = c1
        c1.right_sibling = c2
        c2.right_sibling = c3
        x = depth(c3)
