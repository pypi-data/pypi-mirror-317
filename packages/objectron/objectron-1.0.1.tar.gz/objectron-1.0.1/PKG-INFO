# Objectron

Objectron is a Python module for transforming and tracking Python objects. It provides utilities for transforming Python objects to track their references and observe their operations. It's useful for debugging, testing, and monitoring object behavior.

## Features

- **Reference Transformation:** Transform objects to track and monitor their operations.
- **Attribute Control:** Controlled access to object attributes with custom descriptors.
- **Custom Exceptions:** Clear exception handling for transformation-related errors.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Unit tests covering built-in types and custom classes.

## Installation

You can install Objectron via pip:

```bash
pip install Objectron
```

## Usage
