Substitution plan
=================

In addition to the `smart plan`, substitutions can be
displayed as a traditional substitution plan. The substitution
plan lists all changes made to the regular plan, on a
daily basis, as a table.

In AlekSIS, the substitution plan is available from the menu under
`Timetable â†’ Substitutions`. This function provides a browsable list,
where substitution plans can be navigated by week.

Like for the regular timetable, the substitution plan can be
printed (as a PDF file), to make hardcopies, or to display it
on digital signage.
