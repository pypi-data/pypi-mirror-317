Introduction
############

This module provides access to authentication credentials stored in
``.authinfo`` files.

``.authinfo`` files are based on ``.netrc`` files, and allow a bit more
flexibility, but losing macro support.

They contain entries, formated as plain text, with ``key=${value}``
format fields.

``.authinfo`` files are multiprotocol and allow to do advanced matching.

``.authinfo`` files are typically encrypted using GPG, and this
library will invoke GPG to decrypt ``.authinfo.gpg`` files.

Usage
#####

TL;DR: Here's an example, and for now refer to the tests and code for more.

.. code:: python

   import authinfo

   ...

   entry = get_entry(
    machine='smtp.example.org',
   )
