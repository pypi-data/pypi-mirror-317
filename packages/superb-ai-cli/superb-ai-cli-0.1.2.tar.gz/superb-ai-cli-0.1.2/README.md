## Overview

`superb-ai-cli` is the command line interface for interacting with [Superb Platform](https://superb-ai.com/).

## Installation

You don't need this source code unless you want to modify the package. If you just want to use the package, just run:

```shell
$ pip install --upgrade superb-ai-cli
$ superb --version

Superb Platform CLI. version 0.1.x
```

Once installed, you can type superb command in the terminal to access the command line interface.

### Requirements

Python 3.7+

### Authentication

You need an Access Key for authentication. The Access Key can be generated on the ðŸŽ‰ Superb AI Platform web (Platform > Settings > Access).

You can then configure your profile by entering your Platform Team Name and the generated Access Key.

ðŸš¨ Platform Team Name refers to the organization name that your personal account belongs to:

```bash
$ superb configure

Superb Platform Team Name: foo
Access Key: bar
```

Once configured, you can check the currently configured profile by using the `--list` option.

```bash
$ superb configure --list

[default]
access_key = foo
team_name = bar
```

## Resource Description

### Projects

## Uploading Dataset & Labels

You can upload data and create labels for your project with this command line interface.

Move to the dataset directory that has image files (with extension of `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`) and upload images in the directory by using the following CLI command:

```bash
$ superb upload dataset --name <target_dataset_name> --project <target_project_name> --dir <target_directory>
$ superb upload dataset -n <target_dataset_name> -p <target_project_name> -d <target_directory>
[INFO] Set project success: <target_project_name>
1. Complete describing project.
2. Found 20 data.
Uploading 20 data to project <target_project_name>. Proceed? [y/N] y
3. Start uploading data.
  Worker 0 is started.
  Worker 1 is started.
    Uploading... : Success [<target_directory>/xxx and xxx1.jpg] to [<target_dataset_name>] dataset.
    Uploading... : Success [<target_directory>/xxx and xxx2.jpg] to [<target_dataset_name>] dataset.
4. Complete uploading data.
```

If you wish to upload the **label** files along with the dataset

```shell
$ superb upload labels --project <target_project_name> --dir <target_directory>
$ superb upload labels -p <target_project_name> -d <target_directory>
[INFO] Set project success: <target_project_name>
1. Complete describing project.
2. Found 20 label files.
Uploading 20 label files to the project. Proceed? [y/N]: y
3. Start uploading 20 label files to the project.
  Worker 0 is started.
  Worker 1 is started.
    Uploading... : Success [<target_directory>/xxx/xxx1.jpg.json] to [<target_project_name>] project.
    Uploading... : Success [<target_directory>/xxx/xxx2.jpg.json] to [<target_project_name>] project.
4. Complete uploading label files to the project.
```

To learn how to create a **label** JSON file according to the Superb AI format, please refer to the **Annotation JSON File Structure** section in the linked [Superb AI Platform Manual](https://docs.superb-ai.com/reference/uploading-raw-data-and-labels#uploading-label-files-only).

## Downloading Data & Labels

You can download images and labels for a project by using the following command:

```bash
$ superb download --dir <target_directory> --project <target_project_name>
$ superb download -d <target_directory> -p <target_project_name>
