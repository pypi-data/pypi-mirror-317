 Chainsaw is a sampler that always record what it receive. Once you've eard
 something pleasant, you snapshot the last amount of time to play with. You
 have then two instruments to control the snapshot: Looper and Granulator.

 Chainsaw is OSC controllable through a list of addresses.

 Also midi_chainsaw, a companion, has been shipped to help mapping MIDI
 messages to OSC.
