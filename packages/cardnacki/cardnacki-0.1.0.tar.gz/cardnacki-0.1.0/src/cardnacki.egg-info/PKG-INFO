# cardnacki
Package for working w playing cards

0.1.0 (2024-12-28):
 - introduced breaking changes to Pile
   - initializer no longer requires a type_ attribute 
   - all attributes besides 'cards' must now be a kwarg
   - getter now correctly needs to get one of its own cards, instead of constructing new cards from a random deck
   - alternate constructor must now be given a deck, so it doesn't override any props specific to that deck (for example, a SetbackDeck receiving a game_point attribute)
 - potential breaking change to Card
   - removed attribute "game_points"
   - added attribute dict "attributes", which a caller can added as needed
