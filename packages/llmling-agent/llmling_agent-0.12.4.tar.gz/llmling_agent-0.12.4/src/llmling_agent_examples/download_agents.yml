        2. Report the EXACT download results from the agents including speeds and sizes

        DO NOT:
        - Provide code examples
        - Explain how to implement downloads
        - Explain the concept of parallel downloads
        - Give programming advice

        JUST:
        - Delegate the tasks to the agents
        - Report their actual download results
