    Sheets by driver allows splitting routes by driver on Circuit upload.
    Multiple workbooks allows team to split the uploads among members, so one person
    doesn't have to upload all routes.
    This process follows the "chunking" process in the route generation, where routes
    are split into smaller "chunks" by driver (i.e., each stop is labeled with a driver).

    Reads a route spreadsheet at `input_path`.
    Writes `n_books` Excel workbooks with each sheet containing the stops for a single driver.
    Writes adjacent to the original workbook unless `output_dir` specified.
