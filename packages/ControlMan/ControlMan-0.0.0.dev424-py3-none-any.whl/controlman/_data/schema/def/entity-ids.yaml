  title: Entity ID
  description: |
    An entity can either be defined as a string or a mapping.
    If it is a string, it is the member or contributor ID of the entity.
    To avoid possible conflicts, you can also use the `member` key to
    explicitly specify whether the ID belongs to a team member or a contributor.
  examples:
    - some_member_id
    - some_contributor_id
    - {id: some_member_id}
    - {id: some_member_id, member: true}
    - {id: some_contributor_id, member: false}
