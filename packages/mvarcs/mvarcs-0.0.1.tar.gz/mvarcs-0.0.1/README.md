# mvarcs: Python Mark Verifying Authority Root Certificates

mvarcs provides a collection of Root Certificates for validating 
the trustworthiness of Mark Certificates such as Verified Mark 
Certificates (VMC) and Common Mark Certificates (CMC) used in BIMI 
(Brand Indicators for Message Identification).

Current status: **Alpha**

## Installation

``mvarcs`` is available on PyPI. Simply install it with ``pip``:

``` sh
python -m pip install mvarcs
```

## Usage

To reference the installed certificate authority (CA) bundle, you can use the
built-in function

``` py
import mvarcs
mvarcs.where()
# '/usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages/mvarcs/mvarcs/cacerts.pem'
```

Additionally, you can get the contents directly

``` py
import mvarcs
mvarcs.contents()
# Issuer: ...
# ...
# -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

Or from the command line
``` sh
python -m mvarcs
# /usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages/mvarcs/mvarcs/cacert.pem

python -m mvarcs -c
# Issuer: ...
# ...
# -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```
