.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBXDG_CONFIG_HOME\fP
If set and not empty, this variable determines the directory to use for
user\-local configuration files. We then lookup
\fI${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/diceware/diceware.ini\fP and values set here override
system\-wide config files.
.TP
.B \fBXDG_CONFIG_DIRS\fP
If set and not empty, this variable is interpreted as colon\-separated list
of directories, that might contain system\-wide configuration files. We
lookup \fI<DIR>/diceware/diceware.ini\fP for each directory set in
\fI$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBXDG_DATA_HOME\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
If set and not empty, this variable determines a directory to search for
additional wordlists. We then lookup \fI${XDG_DATA_HOME}/diceware\fP for any
existing wordlist files.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBXDG_DATA_DIRS\fP
If set and not empty, this variable is interpreted as colon\-separated list
of directories, that might contain additional wordlist files. See below. We
lookup \fI<DIR>/diceware/\fP then for each directory set in the list.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH FILES
.sp
Depending on environment variables set (or not set) we lookup certain
directories for configuration files called \fBdiceware.ini\fP and for wordlist
files.
.SS CONFIGURATION FILES
.sp
Configuration settings for \fBdiceware\fP can be spread over several
configuration files. We parse configuration values from the files given below,
but values set in former files take precedence over values set in latter ones.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fI~/.diceware.ini\fP
Your personal diceware configuration file. Values set here override values
from any other configuration file.
.TP
.B \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/diceware/diceware.ini\fP
Additional location for your personal diceware configuration. Values set
here will override any system\-wide valid values but can be overridden by
\fI~/.diceware.ini\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fI$HOME/.config/diceware/diceware.ini\fP
Alternative location for diceware configuration, only used if
\fI${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}\fP is empty or unset.
.TP
.B \fI/etc/xdg/diceware/diceware.ini\fP
If \fB$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS\fP is not set or empty, we look here for a system\-wide
configuration file. Values set here take least precedence.
.UNINDENT
.SS WORDLIST FILES AND WORDLIST DIRECTORIES:
.sp
\fBdiceware\fP comes with a set of wordlists but enables you to add new wordlists
by putting them into certain directories. The paths where the lists are stored
(including the built\-in ones) is shown using \fB\-\-show\-wordlist\-dirs\fP\&.
.sp
Wordlist files are expected to contain lines with one term on each
line and they must have a certain filenames to be found.
.sp
Wordlist filenames have to follow the pattern: \fBwordlist_<NAME>.txt\fP
where \fB<NAME>\fP can be any name consisting of letters, numbers, underscores and
hyphens. For instance \fBwordlist_en_eff.txt\fP is the filename of the EFF
(electronic frontier foundation) word list. \fBen_eff\fP is the name of this list.
.sp
We support \fB\&.txt\fP and \fB\&.asc\fP as filename extensions for wordlists, where
\fB\&.txt\fP files are expected to be plain wordlists and \fB\&.asc\fP files should
provide a PGP\-signature.
.sp
If wordlists with the same name are found in different directories then the one
in the directory with the highest precedence is taken only. The following
locations are ordered by precedence (highest first). Therefore built\-in
wordlists cannot be overridden by custom wordlists. You can, however, use
custom wordlists with a different name.
.sp
Directories we look up that do not exist (in part or completely) are silently
skipped when searching for wordlist files.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fI<INSTALL\-DIR>/wordlists/\fP
The directory containing the built\-in wordlists as part of the
installation. These are the wordlists that are always available, regardless
of configuration values and their exact location depends on the
installation location of the \fBdiceware\fP package.
.TP
.B \fI$XDG_DATA_HOME/diceware/\fP
If $XDG_DATA_HOME is set and not empty, we look in this directory for
wordlists.
.TP
.B \fI$HOME/.local/share/diceware/\fP
If $XDG_DATA_HOME is unset or empty, we look  into this directory for
wordlists.
.TP
.B \fI<DIR>/diceware\fP from \fI$XDG_DATA_DIRS\fP
If $XDG_DATA_DIR is set and not empty, it is interpreted as a
colon\-separated list of directories with \fI/diceware\fP appended. So,
\fI/foo/bar:/baz\fP will make us look into \fI/foo/bar/diceware/\fP and
\fI/baz/diceware/\fP in that order.
.TP
.B \fI/usr/local/share/diceware/\fP, \fI/usr/share/diceware\fP
If $XDG_DATA_DIRS is unset or empty, we look into these two directories for
wordlists.

.SH EXAMPLES
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBdiceware\fP
Create a passphrase using defaults. Outputs something like
\(dq\fBWheelDyeHonkCanvasWitsPuck\fP\(dq
.TP
.B \fBdiceware \-d\fP \fI\(dq\-\(dq\fP \fB\-n\fP \fI3\fP
Create a passphrase with three words, separated by dash (\(dq\fI\-\fP\(dq). Results in
something like \(dq\fBWheel\-Dye\-Honk\fP\(dq
.TP
.B \fBdiceware \-\-no\-caps\fP
Create a passphrase without capital words. Creates something like
\(dq\fBwheel\-dye\-honk\fP\(dq.
.TP
.B \fBdiceware \-r\fP \fIrealdice\fP
Use real dice to create a passphrase. The program will tell you what to do
(roll dice and tell what numbers appear) and in the end present a
passphrase.
.TP
.B \fBdiceware \-r\fP \fIrealdice\fP \fB\-\-dice\-sides\fP \fI20\fP
Use real dice, as shown above, but this time use dice with 20 faces,
instead of standard, 6\-sided dice.
.TP
.B \fBdiceware mywordlist.txt\fP
Create a passphrase with words from file \(dqmywordlist.txt\(dq. The file should
contain one word on each line.
.TP
.B \fBdiceware \-w en_securedrop \-s 2\fP
Create a passphrase with two special chars spread over the generated
passphrase and containing words from wordlist \(dq\fBen_securedrop\fP\(dq. This is
one of the wordlists that come included with \fIdiceware\fP\&. Creates something
like:
\(dq\fBPlayaBrigVer{SeesNe\-tsGets\fP\(dq.
.TP
.B \fBdiceware \-w en_adjectives en_nouns \-n 2\fP
Create two syntactically meaningful phrases, each one consisting of an
adjective and a noun. Results in something like:
\(dq\fBCruelAttendeesCleanCoffee\fP\(dq.
