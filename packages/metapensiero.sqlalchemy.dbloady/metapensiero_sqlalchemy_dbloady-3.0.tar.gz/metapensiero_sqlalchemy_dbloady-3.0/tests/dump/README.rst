 Dump test notes
=================

This exercises the ``dbdumpy`` tool, verifying that its output corresponds to the expected one:
a test database is created and populated with some content, then it gets dumped using the
tool. The result is used to create a second test database, and eventually the test compares the
backups of the two databases.
