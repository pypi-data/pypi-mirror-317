====================
 Preload test notes
====================

This test exercises the *preload* feature, where a custom setup is executed before loading the
YAML dump: in the specific case, the setup installs a special *constructor* and an *implicit
resolver* into the ``pyyaml`` library so that it can recognize particular *time of the day*
values.
