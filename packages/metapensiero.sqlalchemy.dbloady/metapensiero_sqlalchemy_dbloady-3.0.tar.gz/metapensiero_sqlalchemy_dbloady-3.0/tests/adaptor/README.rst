====================
 Adaptor test notes
====================

This test exercise the ability to hook a custom *adaptor* into the load process, that gets
called on each *record*\ 's data just before it gets assigned to the instance. The hooked
function may deliberately change the incoming data, returning a new dictionary that will
eventually used to update the instance.
