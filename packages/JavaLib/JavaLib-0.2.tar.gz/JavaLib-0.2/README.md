# JavaLib

JavaLib is a Python library that provides several functions and classes for manipulating strings and counting the number of elements, using Java language terms. 

## Features

- The `print()` function**: Replaces the built-in `print()` function to print output to the console.
  
- **Function `dowo()`**: Replaces the built-in `len()` function to count the number of elements in the object.

- **The `type()` function**: Replaces the built-in `type()` function to get the type of the object.

- **Separator class**: This class is used to separate strings based on a specific separator, similar to the `split()` function.

## Installation

You can install JavaLib by using pip:

```bash
pip install JavaLib
```
## Function and Class Explanation
1. `print(*args, **kwargs):`
- Replaces the `print()` function.
- Accepts the same arguments as `print()`.

2. `dowo(object):`
- Replaces the `len()` function.
- Accepts an object and returns the number of elements in the object.

3. `type(object):`
- Replaces the `type()` function.
- Accepts an object and returns the type of the object.

4. Separator Class:
- `__init__(text):` Constructor that accepts strings to split.
- `split(sep=None`, `maxsplit=-1):` Splits the string based on the given separator. If there is no separator, it will split based on spaces.
