MedicalSwarm is a sophisticated medical diagnosis and coding platform that leverages a coordinated swarm of specialized AI agents to deliver comprehensive medical assessments, accurate ICD-10 coding, and detailed clinical documentation. The system employs a hierarchical approach with specialized agents working in concert to analyze patient data, generate diagnoses, and ensure coding compliance.

## Key Features

### Multi-Agent Architecture

- Chief Medical Officer: Coordinates diagnosis workflow and synthesizes findings
- Virologist: Specializes in viral disease analysis and progression
- Internist: Provides comprehensive internal medicine evaluation
- Medical Coder: Ensures accurate ICD-10 coding and compliance
- Diagnostic Synthesizer: Creates final integrated assessments


### Enterprise Integration

- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) API support
- Comprehensive logging and telemetry
- Scalable batch processing capabilities
- Configurable output formats and storage


### Clinical Documentation

- Automated ICD-10 code assignment
- Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) coding
- Evidence-based diagnostic rationale
- Detailed clinical progression timelines

## Installation

```bash
pip install mcs
```

## Onboarding
To get started you must first set some envs in your `.env`

```env
WORKSPACE_DIR="agent_workspace"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key"

```

## Usage

```python

from mcs.main import MedicalCoderSwarm
import json

if __name__ == "__main__":
  # Example patient case
  patient_case = """
  Patient: 45-year-old White Male
  Location: New York, NY

  Lab Results:
  - egfr 
  - 59 ml / min / 1.73
  - non african-american
  
  """
  
  swarm = MedicalCoderSwarm(patient_id="Patient-001", max_loops=1, patient_documentation="")
  
  swarm.run(task=patient_case)
  
  print(json.dumps(swarm.to_dict()))
```


## Architecture Overview

    I --> MC[Medical Coder]
    MC --> S[Synthesizer]
    
```

## Features

- **Specialized Agent Roles**: Each agent has specific medical expertise and responsibilities
- **Structured Diagnostic Flow**: Organized pipeline from initial assessment to final synthesis
- **ICD-10 Coding Integration**: Comprehensive medical coding at each diagnostic stage
- **Automated Report Generation**: Standardized medical and coding reports
- **Evidence-Based Decision Making**: Multi-stage verification and synthesis process

```


## API Usage
We have established an api in the `/api` folder. To run the api locally you must git clone, and then run:

```bash
cd api

chmod +x bootup.sh

./bootup.sh

```

### API Testing
When you launch your api you can run the tests to see if it works ;)

```bash
cd api

python3 test.py
```

## Docker Usage

To build and run the Docker container for the Medical Coder Swarm, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker Image**:
  ```bash
  docker build -t mcs .
  ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm mcs
  ```

## Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### To stop the services, run:
```bash
docker-compose down
```




## Lab Range Analysis

The system includes specialized functionality for analyzing lab results against diagnostic criteria:

- Automated range checking for common tests (e.g., eGFR)
- Diagnosis-specific range validation
- Multi-factor analysis for complex diagnoses
