Thank you for your interest in pushing Sphinx-testify boundaries further!
Contributions are very much welcome.

Let’s discuss your idea first - please open an issue in the project's
issue tracker at https://github.com/BasicWolf/sphinx-testify/issues,
and I’ll get back to you as soon as possible.

Let’s also aim to work in the spirit of Testified Documentation,
which means that:

* New or changed behaviour is documented.
* Code changes are tested.
* And the documentation is testified.

Looking forward to collaborating with you!
