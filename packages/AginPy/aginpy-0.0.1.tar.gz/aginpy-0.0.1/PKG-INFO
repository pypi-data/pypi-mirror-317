It's recommended to use a virtual environment for managing dependencies. Below are instructions for setting up a virtual environment on different platforms.

#### **Windows**
1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell).
2. Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

#### **Linux/MacOS**
1. Open a terminal.
2. Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

To deactivate the virtual environment (on any platform), simply run:
```bash
deactivate
```

### **Step 3: Install the Package in Editable Mode**
Install the package in **editable mode** to allow for modifications during development:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## **Usage**

Once installed, you can import and use the library as follows:

```python
from agin import Health

# Create an instance of the Health class
h = Health()

# Check health status
print(h.check_health())  # Output: Health status: Good
```
