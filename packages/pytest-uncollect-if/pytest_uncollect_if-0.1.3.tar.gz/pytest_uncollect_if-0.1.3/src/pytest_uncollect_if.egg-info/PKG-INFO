----

A pytest plugin to uncollect tests based on a condition without the tests being included in the `skipped` for `deselected` report counts. This makes it easier use the `Cartesian product`_ of two different usages of `pytest.mark.parametrize`_ where you want to disable a specific combination.

This `pytest`_ plugin was generated with `Cookiecutter`_ along with `@hackebrot`_'s `cookiecutter-pytest-plugin`_ template.


Requirements
------------

* pytest > 6.2.0

For development requirements, run

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt


Installation
------------

You can install "pytest-uncollect-if" via `pip`_ from `PyPI`_

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pytest-uncollect-if

If you do not have `autoload`_ enabled, add the plugin to your top-level conftest.py

.. code-block:: python

    pytest_plugins = ("pytest_uncollect_if.plugin",)


Usage
-----
The marker takes a single argument :code:`func` which accepts parameters as :code:`**kwargs` and returns a boolean value. If the return value is :code:`True`, the test will be uncollected.
To avoid fragile statements that fail on extra parameters, be sure to add :code:`**kwargs` to your function signature.

.. code-block:: python

    param1_decorator = pytest.mark.parametrize("param1", [1, 2, 3, 4])
    param2_decorator = pytest.mark.parametrize("param2", [1, 2, 3, 4])


    # uncollect if param and param2 are equal
    @pytest.mark.uncollect_if(func=lambda param1, param2, **kwargs: param1 == param2)
    def test_uncollect_if(param1, param2):
        assert param != param2

A typed alias for :code:`pytest.mark.uncollect_if` is available as :code:`uncollect_if`

.. code-block:: python

    from pytest_uncollect_if import uncollect_if

    param1_decorator = pytest.mark.parametrize("param1", [1, 2, 3, 4])
    param2_decorator = pytest.mark.parametrize("param2", [1, 2, 3, 4])


    # uncollect if param and param2 are equal
    @uncollect_if(func=lambda param1, param2, **kwargs: param1 == param2)
    def test_uncollect_if(param1, param2):
        assert param != param2

------------

the coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.
