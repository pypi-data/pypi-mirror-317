This module enhances Odoo's repair process by introducing automatic
stock transfers for repaired products.

- **Automatic Transfer:** When a repair order is marked as done, a stock
  transfer for the remaining repaired products is automatically created
  and validated if the **auto_transfer_repair** parameter is enabled.
- **Manual Transfer:** Users can manually create stock transfers when
  automatic transfer is disabled.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
   `More details on development status <https://odoo-community.org/page/development-status>`_

Configuration
=============

To enable automatic transfers for repaired products when a repair order
is completed:

- Navigate to Repairs → Configuration → Settings.
- Enable the **Automatic Transfer on Repair Completion** setting.

When enabled, internal transfers for repaired products are automatically
created and validated upon completing the repair order.

Usage
=====

**Manual Transfers**

1. After a repair order is marked as **Done**, a **Create Transfer**
   button will appear on the repair order's form view.
2. Click the Create Transfer button to create an internal transfer for
   the repaired products.
3. Specify the destination location and quantity to complete the
   transfer.

**Automatic Transfers**

1. If the **auto_transfer_repair** configuration parameter is enabled,
   an internal transfer is automatically created and validated when the
   repair order is marked as **Done**.
